OH w/ Prof Brandon Seward today. It looks like I have to gain some more intuition (deep understanding) of the definitions/theorems/concepts in order to be able to prove things with less guesswork. This takes more time, but the result will be better in the end. So it might take 10 or 15 minutes to read one page, since it isn't a fiction book you can just skim through. The problems are each unique, so there isn't really a systematic way that will work for every problem. Also seting up a learning environment that is enjoyable or relaxing can lead to more effective learning since you're not stressed and you usually learn better when you're having fun. Very insightful

_Her Loss_ dropped! 🗡️x🦉🔥 Unfortunately, _HEROES AND VILLAINS_ got delayed for "sample clearance" and definitely not bc someone else was dropping today.

Also Stop Breathing has finally made its way onto carti's top 10 popular list!!!!!! (May I humbly add that I predicted a few months ago this might one day happen due to it being the only song on WLR that was gaining streams at a considerable rate under Sky, Vamp Anthem, and ILoveUIHateU)

Isn't it funny how in the present you wish you could be in a better place and that you'd rather get it over with 

but then when you look back you wish you could have enjoyed that time more when it lasted? 

So as much as 19 yr old me didn't like the rushed 7L labs, now I wish I could have enjoyed them more 

And 20 yr old me doesn't like the feeling of being stuck on one problem for super long in Math 140A or grueling late night grinds for pre-labs, post-labs or math hw and often finds 126a lectures un-engaging, but 21 yr old me will more likely than not look back on this and be like "take me back to this time, now I'm struggling with math 154 and cse 30 😭" or something
