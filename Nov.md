OH w/ Prof Brandon Seward today. It looks like I have to gain some more intuition (deep understanding) of the definitions/theorems/concepts in order to be able to prove things with less guesswork. This takes more time, but the result will be better in the end. So it might take 10 or 15 minutes to read one page, since it isn't a fiction book you can just skim through. The problems are each unique, so there isn't really a systematic way that will work for every problem. Also seting up a learning environment that is enjoyable or relaxing can lead to more effective learning since you're not stressed and you usually learn better when you're having fun. Very insightful

_Her Loss_ dropped! 🗡️x🦉🔥 Unfortunately, _HEROES AND VILLAINS_ got delayed for "sample clearance" and definitely not bc someone else was dropping today.

Also Stop Breathing has finally made its way onto carti's top 10 popular list!!!!!! (May I humbly add that I predicted a few months ago this might one day happen due to it being the only song on WLR that was gaining streams at a considerable rate under Sky, Vamp Anthem, and ILoveUIHateU)

RAISING CANE'S PT 2 ! 🐓🔥

Isn't it funny how in the present you wish you could be in a better place and that you'd rather get it over with 

but then when you look back you wish you could have enjoyed that time more when it lasted? 

So as much as 19 yr old me didn't like the rushed 7L labs, now I wish I could have enjoyed them more 

And 20 yr old me doesn't like the feeling of being stuck on one problem for super long in Math 140A or grueling late night grinds for pre-labs, post-labs or math hw and often finds 126a lectures un-engaging, but 21 yr old me will more likely than not look back on this and be like "take me back to this time, now I'm struggling with math 154 and cse 30 😭" or something

One yr since going to downtown SD for the carti concert...

An experience I will not forget anytime soon. Especially jumping into the moshpit when "JumpOutTheHouse" came on. And when he performed "ILoveUIHateU" bro and I heard the Narcissist intro on guitar and the booming bass you could physically feel resounding in your chest and like the back of your neck and other people chanting the lyrics and moshing and how it was dark and there were the lights and smoke machines... (oh yeah but some people were puffing blunts which kinda ruined the vibe bc I really hate the smell and also the Travis Scott Astrofest incident had just happened so I wasn't trying to go TOO crazy) I remember so many scenes from my past ran through my mind at that moment.

Thinking back to the first time I heard it.

I was playing some MC at Ed's house on Christmas day on the release and as soon as I heard the beat I was like holy crap this song I think might be THE ONE (as in an instant classic) because of how the sound immediately caught my ear and you know how much I like Pi'erre beats. Also getting Subway and going to Sheng Kee Bakery and watching _Terminator_. And it was raining outside too so it set the mood..🤧  

Running on the treadmill during Winter quarter 2021 thinking about Cowboy Bebop (you know, besides the possible contemplating life on a rainy evening after getting rejected cathedral music video concept) and seeing the yellow rose in the backyard. Envisioning that this is a song that would play when you're getting on a train in Europe on a frigid December morning and you're wearing on a heavy trench coat and have to carry so much pain from a previous heartbreak but you know you have to not fold under and keep going to go about your work and future goals

When I stepped foot in San Diego and the campus for the first time. The general elation of being in a new environment and listening to WLR in new locations like the bus 

Then the week or so before the concert when I was re-listening to all of Carti's discog on my nighttime bike rides back home from campus

And I know this is after last year's concert, but the performance on Dec 17 last year in Brooklyn NY where Carti starts humming/harmonizing in auto-tune? That made me feel some type of way, it was so beautiful in a bittersweet kind of way, like you can hear the pain in his voice but at the same time it's being used to express something greater than himself and it's not like he's making it all about him. People can relate to the pain and at the same time they can admire the art that came from it so in a sense, Carti's heartbreak becomes our heartbreak and his success becomes our success. By expressing himself in his own personal style, this can be enjoyable or therapeautic for him even if the events that surround it are not necessarily the happiest. Now the fans are the ones listening to the music, but ideally they shouldn't be breathing down the artist's neck or demanding this or that since it's really the artist's freedom to share when they feel it is the best time. Now some artists might do it solely for the money or culture, but if you ask me, only when you take it back to expressing yourself and thinking of it as a journey you share with others will the music really touch others and hold significance

CORYXKENSHIN TURNS 30 TODAY !!!

I don't mean to get all philosophical here, but music helps me keep in touch with my inner self becuase when I feel a sense of awe or appreciation for certain sounds or emotions in music it sort of reassures me that I actually have a soul, because if I was a soulless being, I wouldn't be able to see or feel the beauty in art
