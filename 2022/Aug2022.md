Saw someone from my past today..

Truthfully, the iPhone 6+ audio quality isn't as good as that of newer models

But personally I find that the rough sound works very well with certain songs

e.g. "ILoveUIHateU", "Long Live A$AP", and "911 / Mr. Lonely"

very nostalgic and soothing vibe, like lofi or old radio broadcasts
