Saw someone from my past today..

that I hadn’t seen in like 5 yrs. 

on my reflection walk after finishing *Message to Adolf Pt 2* 

how fitting

Truthfully, the iPhone 6+ audio quality isn't as good as that of newer models

But personally I find that the rough sound works very well with certain songs

e.g. "ILoveUIHateU", "Long Live A$AP", and "911 / Mr. Lonely"

very nostalgic and soothing vibe, like lofi or old radio broadcasts

I mean, at this rate 

ALL $MILES, UTOPIA, P!nk T@pe, Music, and Rihanna's next album could all drop before his.

Well, as long as the album is something different 

and accurately represents him where he's at in his life

it will have been a worthwhile wait. 

(He was kidding about the "from now on, I'll only lie in my albums bc vulnerability is not the same thing as strength" thing right?)
