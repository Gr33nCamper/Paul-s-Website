Saw someone from my past today..

that I hadnâ€™t seen in like 5 yrs. 

on my reflection walk after finishing *Message to Adolf Pt 2* 

how fitting

Truthfully, the iPhone 6+ audio quality isn't as good as that of newer models

But personally I find that the rough sound works very well with certain songs

e.g. "ILoveUIHateU", "Long Live A$AP", and "911 / Mr. Lonely"

very nostalgic and soothing vibe, like lofi or old radio broadcasts
