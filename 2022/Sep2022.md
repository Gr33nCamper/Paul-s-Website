*Half Moon Bay Trip*

We were off to a late start, but still made it to Sam's Chowder House

They kinda finessed me for the halibut tho...

<a href="https://ibb.co/ncTXpKk"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/KqYtn8y/IMG-1939.jpg" alt="IMG-1939" border="0"></a>

Like..cOME ON bRUH, th-THAT'S IT??????

i mean, for $32.95, I thought I would AT LEAST get more food or sides

\**sigh*\* SMH dude... SMH 

&nbsp;

Now I know why we don't eat out like that 

I already don't like dining in and giving tips for service... 

THAT I COULD PERFORM MYSELF

"POURING WATER? OH DEAR, THAT MIGHT BE TOO TROUBLESOME, LET'S HAVE THAT KIND YOUNG GENTLEMEN COME OVER AND DO IT FOR US, ALTHOUGH HE DOES SEEM RATHER OCCUPIED TAKING ORDERS FOR OTHER GUE—" 

BRUH THE PITCHER IS RIGHT THERE, WHY U GOTTA WAIT FOR SUM DUDE TO DO IT FOR YOU ??? 

Listen, if they won't come over, fine. I'LL BE MY OWN WAITER THEN 😤💯

Ed and I actually got up 

went over to the cart with the pitchers 

and refilled our glasses with water.

What? 

They're gonna say it's not allowed or something? 

THIS IS AMERICA! 🇺🇸 🦅

(Besides, we weren't infringing on anyone's rights)

&nbsp;

Crabs Ed picked up at the beach before the meal

&nbsp;

MUCH cooler at the beach, so calming to watch the waves 🌊

and catch the sun ☀️, Vitamin D support

Applied the Neutrogena dry touch sunscreen but later had to rE-apply sunscreen to not get buRNED

miSS mE > w/ that sunbURn.

I don't like feeling greasy 

but I dISlike > getting sUNbURN3D . WAY > m0RE.

nAH FR, im n0T eVN sure hOW eD didn't get burned  

&nbsp;

Drove the highway on the way back

Eyes were watering like crazy, also nose was running like a faucet 

And since it was a little bright outside, wore on da sunglasses 😎 

Those twists and turns kinda had me worried for a sec

Like surely there's no way they expect us to go 60 MPH around a corner like that?? 

Had to slow down for safety reasons ⚠️

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Sep 05, 2022:**

Carti 26th or 27th biRTHdaY t0Day ! 🎂

Also one yr since Narcissist incident.

(*Aside:* but honestly, did people REALLY think Carti was gonna drop something.. 

&nbsp;when it hadn't even been one year since WLR?????)

and 5 yrs since Nudy Land 🎡🍿🥨

---

BACK IN SAN DIEGO!!

Drove to the airport

Right before takeoff, downloaded INLY and listened during flight. 

Hearing "WAIT FOR U" while in the sky looking at the clouds felt like inner peace

I ain't feel like this in a Long Time .

---

Even though it was only a little more than a month

the number of adventures Ed and I had was unbelievable

&nbsp;

Mission Peak hike where we saw coyote

Fremont Art and Wine festival

catching mice during Centerville Campaign

nighttime walks around Lake Elizabeth 

feeding raccoons

seeing da chill cat (black panther) again 

watching *Beast 2022* at Union Landing Century 25

going to SF aquarium of the bay 

driving to Monterey by highway, eating at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.

watching *War Horse*, *Ghostbusters*, *Forrest Gump* (certified hood classic), and *Der Untergang* 

Half Moon bay trip, Sam's chowder house

catching carp in Alameda creek pond

cooking unadon and seafood spaghetti, blending our version of Red Machine

trying new Naked flavors (Red Machine, Pina Colada, Power-C machine)

getting curry pizza to celebrate catching mice, Domino's to celebrate catching carp

surviving heat wave w/o AC, just ice cream, ice water, and watermelon 🥵🔥

Die Lit trip to SF, riding on Bart and Muni, Cal Academy of Sciences, Golden Gate Park, Fairwood Cafe dinner

&nbsp;

Glad it happened 

Slightly sad it will never happen again 🤧

Laugh now, cry later

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Sep 19, 2022:**

You know, I thought living with Casper the scrawny ghost who doesn't touch grass didn't have much of a silver lining. 

Expectation: We're gonna get so close to one another! I'm so glad I can live with another Asian dude who is also from Fremont! I think it'd be awesome to do hw together and help one another. I've been on my own for so long during quarantine, so some company would be nice. 

Reality: "Maybe, but actually...(some bs excuse)", us barely talking to one another besides over text, basically us living our own separate lives, that one prank, him not allowing Ed to stay longer, him cooking at unreasonable hours and being loud in discord calls  

Other than teaching me that my expectations were DEAD WRONG. 

You see, company is cool. But naturally, I prefer being alone.

So the pandemic was just me doing what I usually did.

But if I want to be around others, I'd rather not kick it with lames. 

Like at that point, just let me watch some late-night TV with Panini while we analyze every move the main character makes 🙄 #IAintMessinW/TheseLameN*bbas #StuffedPandasUnderstandMeBetterAnyways

&nbsp;

Also getting ghosted by Ann. 

I know she's probably never gonna see this, but here is what I would say: 

You know what, it's cool. I thought we were still friends but obviously you have very little regard for what we had.

And if five months is too long to go without texting, then I don't want to be your friend anyways. 

You honestly think 

I would make it my entire occupation 

just to message you?

I didn't want to message too often so as to not bother you

and make it more special when I do

But I guess it came across as me not caring enough to text? 

And after some time, there is more to talk about

Unless, of course 

you wanted trivial small talk about something that nobody will give a crap about about even one year from now? 

Oh, I could definitely do that if I wanted to.

Wouldn't be very intellectually stimulating

but if I had nothing better to do 

then yeah, that would be a viable option. 

&nbsp;

Sorry for not being a chatterbox 

Not really my thing. 

Which

knowing me for as long as you have, 

you really should have picked up on sooner. 

I mean, it's not even a hidden trait about me.

Now, if it was something like knowing where I like to run 

or what is it with me and deserts

or why I was acting a fool in the mirror with wigs at 2 in the morning

or why I won't stop talking about *Forrest Gump*

or the significance of *Die Lit* as a life philosophy as well as its connection to my past (alongside *Luv Is Rage 2*)

then yes, I would completely understand why you would not know this about me from only a cursory glance.

&nbsp;

Or if you did already know that 

Why don't you just tell me straight up and be mature about it?

Just say "Hey, I think you're boring af and I would rather talk to other people" 

And I would be like "That's alright. I'm not for everyone. Good luck in your future endeavors"

Like at some point, I'd rather just hear the truth, instead of nothing 

Tell me how you really feel.

Too bad that's too much to ask for from some people.

&nbsp;

And if you ask me, sustained messaging I would prefer 

over talking like crazy, but only for a short time.

Because who's still talking to that person they spent a week with in summer camp having the "time of their lives"? 

Aw man, that was CRAZY how we were singing that song around the campfire and roasting marshmallows and kayaking around the lake. 

&nbsp;

(Ok, I'm gonna keep it real, summer camp sounds FIRE 🔥🏕🛶🌲🏔🎣 

I even wrote about it in my Lost in the Woods book from 6th grade. Camp Greenwood. Creating home defense systems with trash can lids and tomato launchers. The crazy bus driver. Noku and Nakat. Defending the village. Beating up thugs in alleys. Robots with Nerf hailfires and pie catapults. Ring a bell?) 

&nbsp;

Alright, but the point is 

If all you have with that guy is that one experience. 

You can't really take the friendship much further, right? 

It's not very difficult to have a super awesome day with someone 

But if you want to have many awesome experiences with someone over months or years

that takes more work right? 

Because if you see that person a lot

you're bound to rub them the wrong way and have arguments 

but through those moments, you get closer and become a better team

Oh also that person naturally changes over time

so that thing they liked a few years back? 

well...they might actually hate it now

Or like something else more

So you can't just keep doing the same things with them again and again

And expect it to hit the same every time 

To put it another way, think about musical artists. 

Is it easier to drop a single song that goes viral 

Or to have a long-lasting career with many distinct eras and styles, continuously evolving instead of playing it safe and re-making your old stuff that was well-received?

If Carti dropped "Magnolia" as a single and then dipped 

Then "Magnolia" would probably be multi-platinum and do extraordinarily well commercially. 

But then Carti would just be known as "that Magnolia guy" 

A one-hit wonder. 

While it would be hot for some time, it will eventually become irrelevant

Because new music is constantly being released, 

sooner or later, another hit song will come along to replace it

(And people's tastes will change) 

I mean, look at "Miss the Rage" 

It surpassed 100M streams like less than a month after its release 

and was the #1 most popular track for both Carti and Trippie back in May 2021

but by the time summer came, it had already been dethroned by "Sky". And although it took longer, by either early or mid 2022, MTR was also dethroned on Trippie's Spotify (Currently, it sits at #4 with "The Grinch" from ALLTY4 taking the #1 position). 

&nbsp; 

&nbsp; 

Hold on a minute..

Was it easier to make friends when we were younger 

bc we had less stuff in our past??? 

Think about it 

To understand younger me

All you would really need to know is what color I liked, what my fav food was, who my fav superhero was, that I really liked Cartoon Network and playing free online games whether that was on Cartoon Network, Miniclip, Cool Math Games, or Funbrain, etc.

Bc I was so young, I had very little background/history. 

But now that I'm older, you can't really get to know me as easily.

In fact, you can't really get to know anyone that easily in college 

There's a whole volume of history and experiences you have to unpack to fully understand how they became the person they are today

And even then, you probably weren't there for those earlier memories 

So you don't even see the full picture 

I could tell you about me, Rohan, and Manomay playing Lava Ship and Sea Quest on the field

but unless you went to Parkmont around that time, 

you wouldn't know the exact feeling of being out on the grass and having fun in the sun

having to freeze when the bell rang, then walk to class

imagining our adventures and eating lunch together 

The khichdi that Manomay had along with the Mango Frooti, the sandwich burgers Rohan had in his green lunchbox and some chips too

I think I had a bunch of weird lunch items 

whether that was leftover moon cake, chips, pretz roast, dorayaki, sponge cake, cup noodles, or leftover rice and veggies in my BuBee fat ants thermos

&nbsp;

Thinking about all this 

kinda gets me a little sentimental 🤧

Bc on one hand, 

No matter how descriptively I tell it to someone 

They will never actually know what it was like 

But on the other hand, 

that's awesome! 

Bc this experience is a unique personal treasure I can keep forever

It doesn't matter where I am or that it's more than 10 years in the future

I could be on the bus, the trolley, the plane, at my apt, Geisel, a restaurant

I can still think back to a happier time even when the present time may not be as happy

(by which I mean it is more aptly characterized by crying on the inside, midterms, and hunting for internships) 

Okay, I wouldn't go TOO crazy with this bc you already know how I feel about getting too stuck in the past that you can't move forward

Not everything was super great in the past

Even the 1800s had its problems 

I like it for the steamboats, trains and railroads, the Oregon Trail, Gold Rush, Lewis and Clark's expedition, and Wild West frontier expansion

but I can't act like slavery, the Civil War, the Trail of Tears, Lincoln's assasination, dying from cholera, and passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act didn't also happen 

---

Well, basically I just wanted to say that the new Drake album *Honestly, Nevermind* really hits different after having to deal with roommate and someone who I thought was my friend. 

Now I truly see Drake's artistry in a different way.

The lyrics from "Liability" that go:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You put your words together like you getting points for that shit, like you playing Scrabble on me

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your mama the sweetest lady, that apple fell far from the tree

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can't you be honest about your past? Like, how hard can it be?"

are a little too relatable. 

Nah, actually though. Roomie's mom is actually super nice and considerate. Roomie is less so.

Certain girl doesn't talk to me anymore.

&nbsp;

Bear in mind, I haven't exactly heard a lot of the Drake albums. 

Only *Take Care* and *Honestly, Nevermind*.

So if I were to listen to more of his discog, perhaps I would notice a trend where the quality goes down. 

Doesn't mean *Honestly, Nevermind* isn't fire tho. I still like the shift in sound

--- 

Mirada lease ended. LGGGGGGGG.

Now I don't have to see my old roommate for a long time. And no longer getting finessed for rent.

Didn't really have time for cleaning, just dropped off the keys, wrote down forwarding address, and dipped for campus.

They should really do something about adjusting rent for February. Like, full month's rent for only 28 or at most 29 day? Come on, we don't get a small discount or something at least??

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Sep 21, 2022:**

purchased Gloom Shroom from Crazy Dave's shop

tested out the garlic and row of marigolds strategy

might need to modify that for getting the 8k sun achievement one day

Went to H-Mart for dinner and enjoyed a Pork cutlet combo meal just before the place closed

Got ingredients for mashed potatoes (which will be served at the Juniors welcome back potluck)

Brian came by to drop off an OLED switch.

*Ahem* * *Ahem* * BRIAN CAME BY TO DROP OFF AN OLED SWITCH

BRIAN CAME BY TO DROP OFF— Ok ok, I think you get the idea

Nah, but actually he kind of the goat for that you know 

He really didn't have to 

Really

But he did 

And I'm saying we should host him over sometime for a special meal

--- 
2MANY (Taking My Swag) leaked after a group buy for like $8K.

IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

Super unique beat from Richie Souf. Sounds kinda like jumping and there's these short digital beep sounding flares that start soft but then get louder and cut off  

Apparently this was recorded in Oct 2019 

WATCHU KNOW ABOUT DAT BABY VOICE CARTI?? 

I WAS ALIVE DURING THAT TIME YOU KNOW.

I'M LOVING THIS LEAK SZN.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Sep 22, 2022:**

I AM A SPACE CADET THE GEEK THAT REALLLLLLLLLLL 🧑‍🚀🚀🔥👾💕

REALLLLLLL REALLLLLLL REALLLLLLL REALLLLLLL

*EXPLOSIONS AND SPACE BLASTERS GOING OFF*

I KNOW U HEARRRRRR ME CALLINGGGGGGG ☎️

I DONT DOOOOO THIS OFTENNNNNNN 🙅‍♀️

I'M NOT USEDDDDD TO STALLINNNNNNNNNNNN 😤 

I'M JUST USED TO CAA-AY-AYAKE 🍰

&nbsp;

I was listening to "SPACE CADET" as soon as I walked outside

Had the shades on too bc you know it's super bright

Get the right mood going

FA'22 

HAS OFFICIALLY BEGUN

AND NO, WE AINT HERE TO PLAY

FREAK U THINK U THOUGHT, JUST WATCH ME

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Sep 23, 2022:**

Elevator? Nah I always take the stairs bRuh.

bC U nevr > kno when there's gONNa be fire 🔥

By which I mean Carti or Uzi dropping  

Unless there's several floors, in which case I would take an elevator up

but on the way down, I don't mind so much

and you get some extra exercise 

stAiR ! mASt3R . rEAL LiFE > eDiTi0N  

--- 

I may have missed the first foundations of mathematical analysis course today 

bc I stayed up a LITTLE too late last night

was super sweaty last night

but it's all good bc I shower in the mornings 

to get rid of all the grease in one shot. 

You know, like when you wait for a bunch of zombies to enter a lane 

and then incinerate them with a jalapeno? 🌶🔥

I'll need to wash my pillow and blanket covers 

Also the pillow itself after I get a tennis ball 🎾 

bc that thing is F1ltHY

the good news is, I got up around 8:40a which is much earlier than when I've been getting up the past few days (around 11:50a)

Now I just need to sleep around 11 or 12 tonight bc if I try something super early, it won't work.

I tried that before the Carti concert last November by going to bed around 10, but I couldn't fall asleep until like 12 or 1

Also I'll shower before bed this time since I'd rather not bathe in grease for 8 HOURS

--- 

bRUh, RoLLiNG Loud for real stopped the live stream for carti's set 😡 #SmhWeWannaSeeCarti #FalseAdvertising 

I was waiting outside Peterson Hall watching on YouTube with wired headphones, one in and one out

Waited so long that the beat started getting repetitive bruh. Like, they couldn't have cycled between beats or something? 

SWITCH IT UP BRUH I'M TIRED OF HEARING THE SAME LOOPED BEAT AGAIN AND AGAIN 

When they showed the Day 2 setlist screen I was like ok so they're not gonna stream? Bet! I'm outta here

Then I went to Good News Night

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Sep 26, 2022:**

Went to Math 140a lecture for the first time this quarter

(will definitely need to rewatch lectures and go through the proofs by hand) 

Got covid bivalent booster and flu shot

Ordered the chicken kra pow dish from Blue Pepper

bc i'm oVER that BK crap 🍔🍟🥤. that jus aiNT it nOW ❌👎🤮 

McDonald's I think I prefer over BK now 

But if it were up to me, I'd only get burgers from In-N-Out

OR grill them myself in the backyard / park over charcoal with the fresh lettuce 🥬, onion 🧅, tomato 🍅, cheese 🧀, and beef 🥩

---

I couldn't finish all the food before our lab meet up, so I had to drop it in the bag and finish later outside PC

Some grease spilled out, but thankfully that pocket has everything wrapped up in bags

Remind me to bring a spare bag for these cases 

Actually, do they even come up that often? 

I feel like 9 times out of 10 I finish eating what I buy right there on the spot haha 

What? I usually only buy food when I'm super hungry.

Hunger is dA besT sPiCE ! according to the crow from *The Adventures of Pinnochio* 

also Spike Spiegel says something similar when referring to Jet's cooking  

---

First Chem 43a lab meeting. Only thing missing from my drawer was a teflon stir vane

But it was merely a simple task to get from the Stockroom   

People near my area are Wenyi, Daniel, Aaron, and Xavier

Reminded me of the Chem 7L days... 🤧

Where it was Max Bailey, Victor, Ben, Robert, and me

just trying to get through our experimental procedures and measure precisely and accurately

I was wearing my red Columbia rain jacket that day bc I think it was sprinkling a little

going up the stairs in Geisel

felt like I was Spike getting ready to storm the cathedral to fight Vicious in his trench coat and stuff

Fun times

---

but nowadays I'm not SUPER into Bebop anymore

not saying it got bad or something, but it's not really on my mind like that 

I'll have to revisit it one day in the future and see how my perspective changes

I already mentioned how slice of life seems corny as f**k now

bc it's like, I don't find going on trains or buses or shopping at stores novel anymore 

I DO THAT STUFF IN REAL LIFE. 

Now, back in the quarantine era, it was like wow would you look at that! These dudes are flying around space and fighting aliens! Holy crap is that a school with—dare I say it...actual people in it?? That dude's walking back from school on the sidewalk while the sun is setting. Dang, if only I could do that. Alas, it's more like me going to and from the bathroom and my room while watching zoom lectures, working on hw, taking notes, etc.

---

Don't get it twisted though, I still like Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

Not just for understanding the memes, but also bc I gotta find out how they get to Egypt and defeat Dio

Will they save Jotaro's mom from her stand?  

Young Joseph Joestar used to be my fav character, but now I think it's Jotaro bc dude is aH SavAGE 💀

Also R.I.P. Caesar Zepellini bruh 😔🕊🪦

And as for the magical vibe, I've seriously gotta compare Sailor Moon with Onegai My Melody sometime to see which one I like more 

Onegai My Melody has a cleaner look for animation bc it's from the 2000s, but the music goes crazy and the characters are very cute 

Sailor Moon has that hand-drawn, rougher classic 90s style and is so colorful, it's like my eyes are drinking rainbows 

--- 

this dude Ed wants me to watch *Avatar* in theatres

before the second installment releases in December

Apparently it's the second highest grossing film of all time, with *Gone With the Wind* being the number one

I told him I'd watch on the last day of this month, bc we gotta Die Lit 

if it's an international sensation, then it needs a special day

--- 

Oh, also I got into learning some Spanish on the side 🇲🇽 

I have employed Ed Lingo to help me with this 

but actually now his instructor name is la maestra de español Zendeha

Perhaps Edith's alter-ego could bE a high school Spanish teacher??? 😝  

Right now, Paula only has one alter-ego and that is Jenny Argento (silver-haired pokemon trainer)

Her default outfit is as a cowgirl bc she and her family ranch in New Mexico 

You know, really all that is needed to complete those outfits are boots.

Fur boots for Jenny Argento, leather western ones for Paula

If she were to have another alter-ego, that one would have black hair

Other colors like blonde or pink are a little too craZY 

Some of the other modes/outfits Paula can rock are: 

1. Magical/Cutesy stuff fangirl (candy striped sweater or sailor moon longsleeve)   
3. Piano instructor in red coat with necklace 
4. Safari explorer (cargo vest, canteen, outdoor gear, khaki clothing) 
5. Chef, with hair in messy bun but hair tendrils in front at sides
6. Casino card dealer with pink jacket, tuxedo, bowtie
7. Indie Meditation Spiritual Journey enthusiast
8. Volleyball player (headband, water bottle, shorts, athletic shoes)   
9. Vampire clown cowgirl with pink shirt, gray pants, and brown boots
10. Housecleaning maid with headscarf and black and white skirt, super long socks

That's about it for now.
