*Half Moon Bay Trip*

We were off to a late start, but still made it to Sam's Chowder House

They kinda finessed me for the halibut tho...

<a href="https://ibb.co/ncTXpKk"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/KqYtn8y/IMG-1939.jpg" alt="IMG-1939" border="0"></a>

Like..cOME ON bRUH, th-THAT'S IT??????

i mean, for $32.95, I thought I would AT LEAST get more food or sides

\**sigh*\* SMH dude... SMH 

&nbsp;

Now I know why we don't eat out like that 

I already don't like dining in and giving tips for service... 

THAT I COULD PERFORM MYSELF

"POURING WATER? OH DEAR, THAT MIGHT BE TOO TROUBLESOME, LET'S HAVE THAT KIND YOUNG GENTLEMEN COME OVER AND DO IT FOR US, ALTHOUGH HE DOES SEEM RATHER OCCUPIED TAKING ORDERS FOR OTHER GUE—" 

BRUH THE PITCHER IS RIGHT THERE, WHY U GOTTA WAIT FOR SUM DUDE TO DO IT FOR YOU ??? 

Listen, if they won't come over, fine. I'LL BE MY OWN WAITER THEN 😤💯

Ed and I actually got up 

went over to the cart with the pitchers 

and refilled our glasses with water.

What? 

They're gonna say it's not allowed or something? 

THIS IS AMERICA! 🇺🇸 🦅

(Besides, we weren't infringing on anyone's rights)

&nbsp;

Crabs Ed picked up at the beach before the meal

&nbsp;

MUCH cooler at the beach, so calming to watch the waves 🌊

and catch the sun ☀️, Vitamin D support

Applied the Neutrogena dry touch sunscreen but later had to rE-apply sunscreen to not get buRNED

miSS mE > w/ that sunbURn.

I don't like feeling greasy 

but I dISlike > getting sUNbURN3D . WAY > m0RE.

nAH FR, im n0T eVN sure hOW eD didn't get burned  

&nbsp;

Drove the highway on the way back

Eyes were watering like crazy, also nose was running like a faucet 

And since it was a little bright outside, wore on da sunglasses 😎 

Those twists and turns kinda had me worried for a sec

Like surely there's no way they expect us to go 60 MPH around a corner like that?? 

Had to slow down for safety reasons ⚠️

&nbsp;

Also one yr since Narcissist incident.

(*Aside:* but honestly, did people REALLY think Carti was gonna drop something.. 

&nbsp;when it hadn't even been one year since WLR?????)

and 5 yrs since Nudy Land 🎡🍿🥨

---

BACK IN SAN DIEGO!!

Drove to the airport

Right before takeoff, downloaded INLY and listened during flight. 

Hearing "WAIT FOR U" while in the sky looking at the clouds felt like inner peace

I ain't feel like this in a Long Time .

---

Even though it was only a little more than a month

the number of adventures Ed and I had was unbelievable

&nbsp;

Mission Peak hike where we saw coyote

Fremont Art and Wine festival

catching mice during Centerville Campaign

nighttime walks around Lake Elizabeth 

feeding raccoons

seeing da chill cat (black panther) again 

watching *Beast 2022* at Union Landing Century 25

going to SF aquarium of the bay 

driving to Monterey by highway, eating at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.

watching *War Horse*, *Ghostbusters*, *Forrest Gump* (certified hood classic), and *Der Untergang* 

Half Moon bay trip, Sam's chowder house

catching carp in Alameda creek pond

cooking unadon and seafood spaghetti, blending our version of Red Machine

trying new Naked flavors (Red Machine, Pina Colada, Power-C machine)

getting curry pizza to celebrate catching mice, Domino's to celebrate catching carp

surviving heat wave w/o AC, just ice cream, ice water, and watermelon 🥵🔥

Die Lit trip to SF, riding on Bart and Muni, Cal Academy of Sciences, Golden Gate Park, Fairwood Cafe dinner

&nbsp;

Glad it happened 

Slightly sad it will never happen again 🤧

Laugh now, cry later

**Sep 19, 2022:**

You know, I thought living with Casper the scrawny ghost who doesn't touch grass didn't have much of a silver lining. 

Expectation: We're gonna get so close to one another! I'm so glad I can live with another Asian dude who is also from Fremont! I think it'd be awesome to do hw together and help one another. I've been on my own for so long during quarantine, so some company would be nice. 

Reality: "Maybe, but actually...(some bs excuse)", us barely talking to one another besides over text, basically us living our own separate lives, that one prank, him not allowing Ed to stay longer, him cooking at unreasonable hours and being loud in discord calls  

Other than teaching me that my expectations were DEAD WRONG. 

You see, company is cool. But naturally, I prefer being alone.

So the pandemic was just me doing what I usually did.

But if I want to be around others, I'd rather not kick it with lames. 

Like at that point, just let me watch some late-night TV with Panini while we analyze every move the main character makes 🙄 #IAintMessinW/TheseLameN*bbas #StuffedPandasUnderstandMeBetterAnyways

&nbsp;

Also getting ghosted by Ann. 

I know she's probably never gonna see this, but here is what I would say: 

You know what, it's cool. I thought we were still friends but obviously you have very little regard for what we had.

And if five months is too long to go without texting, then I don't want to be your friend anyways. 

You honestly think 

I would make it my entire occupation 

just to message you?

I didn't want to message too often so as to not bother you

and make it more special when I do

But I guess it came across as me not caring enough to text? 

And after some time, there is more to talk about

Unless, of course 

you wanted trivial small talk about something that nobody will give a crap about about even one year from now? 

Oh, I could definitely do that if I wanted to.

Wouldn't be very intellectually stimulating

but if I had nothing better to do 

then yeah, that would be a viable option. 

&nbsp;

Sorry for not being a chatterbox 

Not really my thing. 

Which

knowing me for as long as you have, 

you really should have picked up on sooner. 

I mean, it's not even a hidden trait about me.

Now, if it was something like knowing where I like to run 

or what is it with me and deserts

or why I was acting a fool in the mirror with wigs at 2 in the morning

or why I won't stop talking about *Forrest Gump*

or the significance of *Die Lit* as a life philosophy as well as its connection to my past (alongside *Luv Is Rage 2*)

then yes, I would completely understand why you would not know this about me from only a cursory glance.

&nbsp;

Or if you did already know that 

Why don't you just tell me straight up and be mature about it?

Just say "Hey, I think you're boring af and I would rather talk to other people" 

And I would be like "That's alright. I'm not for everyone. Good luck in your future endeavors"

Like at some point, I'd rather just hear the truth, instead of nothing 

Tell me how you really feel.

Too bad that's too much to ask for from some people.

&nbsp;

And if you ask me, sustained messaging I would prefer 

over talking like crazy, but only for a short time.

Because who's still talking to that person they spent a week with in summer camp having the "time of their lives"? 

Aw man, that was CRAZY how we were singing that song around the campfire and roasting marshmallows and kayaking around the lake. 

&nbsp;

(Ok, I'm gonna keep it real, summer camp sounds FIRE 🔥🏕🛶🌲🏔🎣 

I even wrote about it in my Lost in the Woods book from 6th grade. Camp Greenwood. Creating home defense systems with trash can lids and tomato launchers. The crazy bus driver. Noku and Nakat. Defending the village. Beating up thugs in alleys. Robots with Nerf hailfires and pie catapults. Ring a bell?) 

&nbsp;

Alright, but the point is 

If all you have with that guy is that one experience. 

You can't really take the friendship much further, right? 

It's not very difficult to have a super awesome day with someone 

But if you want to have many awesome experiences with someone over months or years

that takes more work right? 

Because if you see that person a lot

you're bound to rub them the wrong way and have arguments 

but through those moments, you get closer and become a better team

Oh also that person naturally changes over time

so that thing they liked a few years back? 

well...they might actually hate it now

Or like something else more

So you can't just keep doing the same things with them again and again

And expect it to hit the same every time 

To put it another way, think about musical artists. 

Is it easier to drop a single song that goes viral 

Or to have a long-lasting career with many distinct eras and styles, continuously evolving instead of playing it safe and re-making your old stuff that was well-received?

If Carti dropped "Magnolia" as a single and then dipped 

Then "Magnolia" would probably be multi-platinum and do extraordinarily well commercially. 

But then Carti would just be known as "that Magnolia guy" 

A one-hit wonder. 

While it would be hot for some time, it will eventually become irrelevant

Because new music is constantly being released, 

sooner or later, another hit song will come along to replace it

And people's tastes will change 

I mean, look at "Miss the Rage". 

It surpassed 100M streams like less than a month after its release 

and was the #1 most popular track for both Carti and Trippie back in May 2021

but by the time summer came, it had already been dethroned by "Sky". And although it took longer, by either early or mid 2022, MTR was dethroned as well on Trippie's Spotify (Currently, it sits at #4 with "The Grinch" from ALLTY4 taking the #1 position). 

&nbsp; 

&nbsp; 

Hold on a minute..

Was it easier to make friends when we were younger 

bc we had less stuff in our past??? 

Think about it 

To understand younger me

All you would really need to know is what color I liked, what my fav food was, who my fav superhero was, that I really liked Cartoon Network and playing free online games whether that was on Cartoon Network, Miniclip, Cool Math Games, or Funbrain, etc.

Bc I was so young, I had very little background/history. 

But now that I'm older, you can't really get to know me as easily.

In fact, you can't really get to know anyone that easily in college 

There's a whole volume of history and experiences you have to unpack to fully understand how they became the person they are today

And even then, you probably weren't there for those earlier memories 

So you don't even see the full picture 

I could tell you about me, Rohan, and Manomay playing Lava Ship and Sea Quest on the field

but unless you went to Parkmont around that time, 

you wouldn't know the exact feeling of being out on the grass and having fun in the sun

having to freeze when the bell rang, then walk to class

imagining our adventures and eating lunch together 

The khichdi that Manomay had along with the Mango Frooti, the sandwich burgers Rohan had in his green lunchbox and some chips too

I think I had a bunch of weird lunch items 

whether that was leftover moon cake, chips, pretz roast, dorayaki, sponge cake, cup noodles, or leftover rice and veggies in my BuBee fat ants thermos

&nbsp;

Thinking about all this 

kinda gets me a little sentimental 🤧

Bc on one hand, 

No matter how descriptively I tell it to someone 

They will never actually know what it was like 

But on the other hand, 

that's awesome! 

Bc this experience is a unique personal treasure I can keep forever

It doesn't matter where I am or that it's more than 10 years in the future

I could be on the bus, the trolley, the plane, at my apt, Geisel, a restaurant

I can still think back to a happier time even when the present time may not be as happy

(by which I mean it is more aptly characterized by crying on the inside, midterms, and hunting for internships) 

Okay, I wouldn't go TOO crazy with this bc you already know how I feel about getting too stuck in the past that you can't move forward

Not everything was super great in the past

Even the 1800s had its problems 

I like it for the steamboats, trains and railroads, the Oregon Trail, Gold Rush, Lewis and Clark's expedition, and Wild West frontier expansion

but I can't act like slavery, the Civil War, the Trail of Tears, Lincoln's assasination, dying from cholera, and passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act didn't also happen 

---

Well, basically I just wanted to say that the new Drake album *Honestly, Nevermind* really hits different after having to deal with roommate and someone who I thought was my friend. 

Now I truly see Drake's artistry in a different way.

The lyrics from "Liability" that go:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You put your words together like you getting points for that shit, like you playing Scrabble on me

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your mama the sweetest lady, that apple fell far from the tree

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can't you be honest about your past? Like, how hard can it be?"

are a little too relatable. 

Nah, actually though. Roomie's mom is actually super nice and considerate. Roomie is less so.

Certain girl doesn't talk to me anymore.

&nbsp;

Bear in mind, I haven't exactly heard a lot of the Drake albums. 

Only *Take Care* and *Honestly, Nevermind*.

So if I were to listen to more of his discog, perhaps I would notice a trend where the quality goes down. 

Doesn't mean *Honestly, Nevermind* isn't fire tho. I still like the shift in sound

--- 

Mirada lease ended. LGGGGGGGG.

Now I don't have to see my old roommate for a long time. And no longer getting finessed for rent.

Didn't really have time for cleaning, just dropped off the keys, wrote down forwarding address, and dipped for campus.

They should really do something about adjusting rent for February. Like, full month's rent for only 28 or at most 29 day? Come on, we don't get a small discount or something at least??
