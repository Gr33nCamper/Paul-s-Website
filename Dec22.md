Theory 1: Being at work makes time slow down

Theory 2: Time flies when you‚Äôre having fun

Theory 3: Life goes by faster the older you get

Theory 4: Anything becomes nostalgic given enough time even if it wasn‚Äôt fun in the moment

Fact: Each successive year is a smaller and smaller fraction of your life the older you get

**Dec 03, 2022:**

Won my first Monopoly game! üé©üí∞

Also I finally learned what a double is (roll a pair of the same number with dice)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Dec 04, 2022:**

For problem 6 on the practice final I was like, if b = min(ùõø, Œµ/2) how do you know for sure that d(x, p) < b => d(x,p) < Œµ/2??? 

But then it hit me

Case 1 : ùõø > Œµ/2. Then b = Œµ/2 and it is obvious that d(x,p) < Œµ/2  

Case 2 : ùõø ‚â§ Œµ/2. Then b =  ùõø and d(x,p) < ùõø < Œµ/2

You know what, we just do it. I can‚Äôt fall for those same tricks again. You already know what‚Äôs gonna happen if you give in, so don‚Äôt do it. 

Dark Ages PvZ2 goes crazy also sunshrooms are kinda op 

New food unlocked: Breakfast onigiri üçôü•ìüç≥!!!! Also tested out the compact giant fan, it works quite well

I liked the Ube cookie. Bacon QPC was alright but some lettuce would have helped

&nbsp;

**Dec 07, 2022:**

Pleasantly surprised to run into Audria today. I told her about getting a white elephant gift and also how we wanted to decorate a lamp 

R.I.P. Fenrir bruh üê∫ü™¶

Evil unnamed former roommate be like: I don‚Äôt disturb my roomie‚Äôs sleep at night and we spend quality time together. We share each other‚Äôs happiness and pain and accept each other for who we are without judgment 

Evil unnamed former female giftshop co-staffer be like: I reply to texts from people I used to know.  In addition, I don‚Äôt erroneously assume others are pathetic, clingy losers just bc they‚Äôre messaging me when they could be messaging others closer to them. Also I keep my promise to take people to 7Leaves 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Dec 08, 2022:**

Bought a lil gift for White Elephant with a personal touch to it üòâ. T‚Äôis the season of giving   

World Market got us covered. It‚Äôs got some exclusive stuff you wouldn‚Äôt be able to get at any ol‚Äô Target or Walmart. But I shouldn‚Äôt assume everyone else‚Äôs gift is gonna be generic af, bc who knows? Someone else might have a more fire gift

Thinking back more, I think my proofs on the final could definitely use more precise terms because it didn't make use of a lot of symbols. 

Now words can get their meanings twisted but you can't exactly misinterpret A ‚ãÇ B = ‚àÖ right? Also it gets a little verbose writing out the whole definition. If a guy told me, well by this definition, this follows and you can see that the complement is open so now we have that the original set was closed but didn't give any specific example of the arbitrary points he used or what set he constructed, I wouldn't be so convinced. 

Perhaps I assume too much knowledge from the graders, which obviously they have but ofc the purpose isn't just to get the answer right but to convince others (and yourself) why it must be true

**Dec 09, 2022:** 

Started off leaping out of bed to take the 103A final. 

Pleasantly surprised it was super similar to the practice final and also the correct answer gets full points policy (with correct work giving partial credit). Also no proofs

Before the year ended, I had to try Main Chick Supreme spice üî•üî•üî•üî•üî• 

So the thing is

It wasn't lethal, but it did hurt like hekkkkkkkkkk

Like you had to gargle/ rinse your mouth with milk, if you just sipped it, the heat would just flare up again

Insulating with starch proved pretty effective. Also coating the chicken with a bunch of sauce

---

ü´° FA22 over. We outta here

I think this year alone I‚Äôve flown more times than in elementary, middle school, and high school combined

Pulled up to Tristan's house and gave him some of the chicken to try

Ed also tried some of the spicy supreme and he was burning up

Nick the Greek had very speedy service, and I think it's the best Gyro I've had so far. 

Way better than Santorini Greek Grill that's for sure

Celebrated Bradly's birthday at his dad's house in Hayward. Apparently his dad's name is also Paul

We picked up some Filipino food beforehand but the customer service wasn't really the best. They initially gave us a whole box of rice even though we didn't ask for that. 

Watched _Bullet Train_ later and it was awesome, to be honest, I wasn't sure that movies were still good these days. Meanwhile, I don't think Marvel has missed yet with the run of Shang Chi, No Way Home, Dr. Strange, and then Wakanda Forever

Went lifting today at City Sports club 

Felt very refreshing afterwards, and breathing in the night air after exercising and relieving stress 

People gonna say this and that but I'm not rushing the process of getting more fit. It's not just for looks, I mean, I know some people only do it for physique but like if you're not gonna use it, it's not really worth it imo. I don't ever want to be like "Hey everybody watch this! I can lift this much!" but just as a party trick. Come on man, I didn't spend time and money just to impress strangers. What is that worth a few months later? Nothing. At the end of the day, you should do it for yourself but more importantly for the Lord, not empty praise

This guy won't shut up about it huh? 

gO tO tHe gyM wItH mE. gO tO tHe gyM wItH mE. gO tO tHe gyM wItH mE. 

Ok. I went with you 

Now quit bugging me and do some sht on your own

Why some people feel the need to stunt on others like that I will never understand. If you need to prove you're better than me, doesn't that mean it's not self-evident? You think you're showing your strength but really all I see your biggest insecurities. Isn't that something we learned from one of the messages? What we show off to others is often closely related to what we feel most insecure about? The wealthy man shows off his possessions and money in the hopes that he'll get other people to respect him and see him as worthy of praise. Call him what you want, but you can't call him poor, right? The intelligent man shows off his intelligence because he doesn't want to be seen as dumb or uneducated. The strong man shows off his physique and fitness because he doesn't want to appear weak. The popular guy brags about followers or friends or likes on their posts, because they don't want to appear irrelevant or unloved. In whatever way they can, people try to prove their worth to others, but it never really works because someone will always be more skilled than them in their area. So only if our identitiy is in Christ will it truly be unshakable

We shouldn't be content with mediocrity, but at the same time, the purpose of doing better shouldn't be to prove your worth to others. In its purest form, if you want to improve yourself, you would do it to compete with yourself, using your previous self as a metric, which is in my opinion really the best standard there is for measuring your abilities, that is. You shouldn't use yourself as a standard for right and wrong, since everyone is biased towards themselves. You might excuse yourself for something other people would disapprove of and you might disapprove of something a lot of other people seem to approve of. Only God is impartial and always correct in saying what's right and wrong
