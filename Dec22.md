Theory 1: Being at work makes time slow down

Theory 2: Time flies when you’re having fun

Theory 3: Life goes by faster the older you get

Theory 4: Anything becomes nostalgic given enough time even if it wasn’t fun in the moment

Fact: Each successive year is a smaller and smaller fraction of your life the older you get

I’m convinced that starting from 2018, a notable fire record or track always drops in December

Won my first Monopoly game! 🎩💰

Also I finally learned what a double is (roll a pair of the same number with dice)

For problem 6 on the practice final I was like, if b = min(𝛿, ε/2) how do you know for sure that d(x, p) < b => d(x,p) < ε/2??? 

But then it hit me

Case 1 : 𝛿 > ε/2. Then b = ε/2 and it is obvious that d(x,p) < ε/2  

Case 2 : 𝛿 ≤ ε/2. Then b =  𝛿 and d(x,p) < 𝛿 < ε/2

You know what, we just do it. I can’t fall for those same tricks again. You already know what’s gonna happen if you give in, so don’t do it. 

Dark Ages PvZ2 goes crazy also sunshrooms are kinda op

I liked the Ube cookie. Bacon QPC was alright but some lettuce would have helped

Pleasantly surprised to run into Audria today. I told her about getting a white elephant gift and also how we wanted to decorate a lamp 

R.I.P. Fenrir bruh 🐺🪦

Evil unnamed former roommate be like: I don’t disturb my roomie’s sleep at night and we spend quality time together. We share each other’s happiness and pain and accept each other for who we are without judgment 

Evil unnamed former female giftshop co-staffer be like: I reply to texts from people I used to know.  In addition, I don’t erroneously assume others are pathetic, clingy losers just bc they’re messaging me when they could be messaging others closer to them. Also I keep my promise to take people to 7Leaves

Bought a lil gift for White Elephant with a personal touch to it 😉. T’is the season of giving   

World Market got us covered. It’s got some exclusive stuff you wouldn’t be able to get at any ol’ Target or Walmart. But I shouldn’t assume everyone else’s gift is gonna be generic af, bc who knows? Someone else might have a more fire gift

Thinking back more, I think my proofs on the final could definitely use more precise terms because it didn't make use of a lot of symbols. 

Now words can get their meanings twisted but you can't exactly misinterpret A ⋂ B = ∅ right? Also it gets a little verbose writing out the whole definition. If a guy told me, well by this definition, this follows and you can see that the complement is open so now we have that the original set was closed but didn't give any specific example of the arbitrary points he used or what set he constructed, I wouldn't be so convinced. 

Perhaps I assume too much knowledge from the graders, which obviously they have but ofc the purpose isn't just to get the answer right but to convince others (and yourself) why it must be true
