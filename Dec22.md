Theory 1: Being at work makes time slow down

Theory 2: Time flies when you‚Äôre having fun

Theory 3: Life goes by faster the older you get

Theory 4: Anything becomes nostalgic given enough time even if it wasn‚Äôt fun in the moment

Fact: Each successive year is a smaller and smaller fraction of your life the older you get

**Dec 03, 2022:**

Won my first Monopoly game! üé©üí∞

Also I finally learned what a double is (roll a pair of the same number with dice)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Dec 04, 2022:**

For problem 6 on the practice final I was like, if b = min(ùõø, Œµ/2) how do you know for sure that d(x, p) < b => d(x,p) < Œµ/2??? 

But then it hit me

Case 1 : ùõø > Œµ/2. Then b = Œµ/2 and it is obvious that d(x,p) < Œµ/2  

Case 2 : ùõø ‚â§ Œµ/2. Then b =  ùõø and d(x,p) < ùõø < Œµ/2

You know what, we just do it. I can‚Äôt fall for those same tricks again. You already know what‚Äôs gonna happen if you give in, so don‚Äôt do it. 

Dark Ages PvZ2 goes crazy also sunshrooms are kinda op 

New food unlocked: Breakfast onigiri üçôü•ìüç≥!!!! Also tested out the compact giant fan, it works quite well

I liked the Ube cookie. Bacon QPC was alright but some lettuce would have helped

Pleasantly surprised to run into Audria today. I told her about getting a white elephant gift and also how we wanted to decorate a lamp

Evil unnamed former roommate be like: I don‚Äôt disturb my roomie‚Äôs sleep at night and we spend quality time together. We share each other‚Äôs happiness and pain and accept each other for who we are without judgment 

Evil unnamed former female giftshop co-staffer be like: I reply to texts from people I used to know.  In addition, I don‚Äôt erroneously assume others are pathetic, clingy losers just bc they‚Äôre messaging me when they could be messaging others closer to them. Also I keep my promise to take people to 7Leaves 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Dec 08, 2022:**

Bought a lil gift for White Elephant with a personal touch to it üòâ. T‚Äôis the season of giving   

World Market got us covered. It‚Äôs got some exclusive stuff you wouldn‚Äôt be able to get at any ol‚Äô Target or Walmart. But I shouldn‚Äôt assume everyone else‚Äôs gift is gonna be generic af, bc who knows? Someone else might have a more fire gift

Thinking back more, I think my proofs on the final could definitely use more precise terms because it didn't make use of a lot of symbols. 

Now words can get their meanings twisted but you can't exactly misinterpret A ‚ãÇ B = ‚àÖ right? Also it gets a little verbose writing out the whole definition. If a guy told me, well by this definition, this follows and you can see that the complement is open so now we have that the original set was closed but didn't give any specific example of the arbitrary points he used or what set he constructed, I wouldn't be so convinced. 

Perhaps I assume too much knowledge from the graders, which obviously they have but ofc the purpose isn't just to get the answer right but to convince others (and yourself) why it must be true

&nbsp;

&nbsp; 

**Dec 09, 2022:** 

Started off leaping out of bed to take the 103A final. 

Pleasantly surprised it was super similar to the practice final and also the correct answer gets full points policy (with correct work giving partial credit). Also no proofs

Before the year ended, I had to try Main Chick Supreme spice üî•üî•üî•üî•üî• 

So the thing is

It wasn't lethal, but it did hurt like hekkkkkkkkkk

Like you had to gargle/ rinse your mouth with milk, if you just sipped it, the heat would just flare up again

Insulating with starch proved pretty effective. Also coating the chicken with a bunch of sauce

---

ü´° FA22 over. We outta here

I think this year alone I‚Äôve flown more times than in elementary, middle school, and high school combined

Pulled up to Tristan's house and gave him some of the chicken to try

Ed also tried some of the spicy supreme and he was burning up

Celebrated Bradly's birthday at his dad's house in Hayward. Apparently his dad's name is also Paul

We picked up some Filipino food beforehand but the customer service wasn't really the best. They initially gave us a whole box of rice even though we didn't ask for that.

Watched _Bullet Train_ later and it was awesome, to be honest, I wasn't sure that movies were still good these days. Meanwhile, I don't think Marvel has missed yet with the run of Shang Chi, No Way Home, Dr. Strange, and then Wakanda Forever

Went lifting today at City Sports club

Felt very refreshing afterwards, and breathing in the night air after exercising and relieving stress

People gonna say this and that but I'm not rushing the process of getting more fit. It's not just for looks, I mean, I know some people only do it for physique but like if you're not gonna use it, it's not really worth it imo. I don't ever want to be like "Hey everybody watch this! I can lift this much!" but just as a party trick. Come on man, I didn't spend time and money just to impress strangers. What is that worth a few months later? Nothing. At the end of the day, you should do it for yourself but more importantly for the Lord, not empty praise

This guy won't shut up about it huh?

gO tO tHe gyM wItH mE. gO tO tHe gyM wItH mE. gO tO tHe gyM wItH mE. 

Ok. I went with you 

Now quit bugging me and do some sht on your own

Why some people feel the need to stunt on others like that I will never understand. If you need to prove you're better than me, doesn't that mean it's not self-evident? You think you're showing your strength but really all I see your biggest insecurities. Isn't that something we learned from one of the messages? What we show off to others is often closely related to what we feel most insecure about? The wealthy man shows off his possessions and money in the hopes that he'll get other people to respect him and see him as worthy of praise. Call him what you want, but you can't call him poor, right? The intelligent man shows off his intelligence because he doesn't want to be seen as dumb or uneducated. The strong man shows off his physique and fitness because he doesn't want to appear weak. The popular guy brags about followers or friends or likes on their posts, because they don't want to appear irrelevant or unloved. In whatever way they can, people try to prove their worth to others, but it never really works because someone will always be more skilled than them in their area. So only if our identitiy is in Christ will it truly be unshakable

We shouldn't be content with mediocrity, but at the same time, the purpose of doing better shouldn't be to prove your worth to others. In its purest form, if you want to improve yourself, you would do it to compete with yourself, using your previous self as a metric, which is in my opinion really the best standard there is for measuring your abilities, that is. You shouldn't use yourself as a standard for right and wrong, since everyone is biased towards themselves. You might excuse yourself for something other people would disapprove of and you might disapprove of something a lot of other people seem to approve of. Only God is impartial and always correct in saying what's right and wrong

Made pretty good use of guest pass last day, in my humble opinion
  
Focused more on legs, but still did some upper body work

Swimming was quite fun and I was hungry af afterwards

Turns out my technique for swimming was a little rusty. Freestyle you're supposed to keep ur body as straight as possible and make small rapid kicks every 1-1.5 seconds or so. And for breast stroke your legs and arms aren't supposed to go at the same time.

We thought we were gonna get In-N-Out, but the Drive-Thru was super long. 

So we went to TGI Fridays instead. It was pretty good but the wings were super small and I thought the portion sizes could be larger. Ended up coming back home around midnight

Misis strikes again, we'll need to mount a winter offensive
  
Made the tomato egg stir-fry for the first time in a long time
  
Called Jack today, lookz like he trying out some Sichuan dialect
  
Messaged some people from my past 
  
Dropped something in the group chat but highly doubt people gonna link up, if I learned anything from last time it's that everyone wants to link up but nobody wants to be the one to plan it which is dumb bc if u don't plan it how tf u gonna meet up? Random chance????
  
Also what's up with people acting too cool for sht and trying to get clout off others that sht corny as hell. Can't we just talk to each other human to human, putting our pride aside?

Ok so we didn't actually finesse 24Hr Fitness...yet

Surprised that Wesley and I were able to have a conversation over Messenger so easily bc it's been a while since we last talked to one another. I enjoyed hearing about what was going on with the UC-wide grad student strike over at UC Santa Cruz. He said that the strikers are kinda asking for more than they deserve which is acting entitled. And if they really want affordable housing, they have to seek it out early and aggressivley. He claims even if the pay isn't that good, it's still enough to live on. They won't be able to buy luxuries, but necessities can definitely be covered

You wouldn't believe it, but the Google Form method actually worked! We narrowed it down to Wednesday evening between 6 and 9p. So in fact, the planning did go somewhere

**Dec 17, 2022:**

_The Fame_ by Lady Gaga goes hard bruh 

I feel like this year I've been more open to music genres and vibes other than rap and hip hop whether that's indie pop, disco, country, rock, metal, Latin, opera, 90s R&B, soul, medieval music, hyperpop, phonk, house music, etc 

--- 

After watching Anime House finale by RDCworld1, I'm curious about One Piece, Death Note, and Yu Yu Hakusho. Well, I was thinking about entering a pirate arc but now I'm thinking Death Note captures my interest more

--- 

Glad I went out for a solo run today, it was quite beautiful outside and felt more alive breathing in the fresh air and getting sun. Also it was fun to skip tracks that didn't fit the mood, like nah I'm not feeling this one let's swap it out. Like you're not forced to sit through a song that doesn't go with running, you're not obligated to give your time to listen to that song it's a free market economy if you like it, then listen if you don't feel like listening, don't force yourself to listen to it just to appear like a loyal fan. Like even though I liked Tyler, The Creator a lot back in high school, I don't really listen to his music all that much these days, people's tastes change over time and it's ok

---

Well, everyone except Siraj is free on Wednesday evening. And after the upcoming Friday, Rishab will be in Florida.

As for me, the week of 12/25 - 12/31, I'll only be free 12/26 and 12/27. Since 12/28 is when we're leaving for the ski trip

Either way it goes, some of us won't be able to make it. Just comes to show how early you have to plan something for even the most remote chance of it happening and also how much more difficult it is to get your friends together after you all graduated

Gideon brought down da gift from White Elephant! Also I hope whoever got the golden cat nutcracker enjoys it
  
Returned to Fairwood Cafe. Baked #1 Pork Chop was delicious! Also the seafood curry and Borsch soup

It was frigid at Lake Elizabeth

24Hr Fitness kinda wasn't it. Cramped and the machines aren't as good for lifting

&nbsp; 
  
&nbsp;  

**Dec 20, 2022:** 

We finally saw the Ghost Cat!

Dentist appointment. Found out I need to floss the sides of the tooth, not just directly in the gap. That will combat the brown stains. Also brushing longer but gently, like a massage
  
AVATAR: WAY OF WATER was fire, better than the first but not on the order of 1000x. I like the Loak and Payakan friendship and seeing Jake as a father. However, it lacked a level of depth shown in the first movie since it shows so much of Jake's development but in this one the focus is more on saving his kids
  
Got some fried calamari for dinner, then found out from Vaush that Trump has trading cards now and is in a lot of debt from lawsuits. 
  
&nbsp; 
  
&nbsp;
  
**Dec 21, 2022:**

No success with shark fishing today due to low tide, but explored new locations: Foster City, San Mateo, and Burlingame. Also listened to a lot more Avatar soundtrack and learned some more about the backrooms

Haha imagine organizing a link-up but nobody actually talks to you during the link-up they just talk to each other haha wouldn't that be like so awkward like bro you literally set it up but they show barely any appreciation or respect like ok I guess you don't care that's cool. Definitely couldn't be me guys, just throwing this out there, honestly I'm fine. What?? No I'm not crying, I've just been cutting onions for this burrito the past hour anyways can you pass me the red and green salsa, this is a New Mexico Christmas we're talking about.

Sushi was fire, but definitely not worth the side of un-inclusive conversation. At that point, I'd rather just eat alone.

Needless to say, I guess I'll be occupied Jan 02. No hard feelings, I don't feel like the "homies" and I are that close anymore. Without proximity, there's no real stuff to talk about and I'm sorry but I'm not the guy to be all chatty about my life like that. And you know what, it's fine if you don't want to know about me, I'll just talk about it to someone else who wants to know, whether that's the Lord, a camera, or Panini

Ah haha, *polite laughter* üôÇüòê

Next time, organize for yourselves. I'm not doing that shi no more

Nothing personal, but the squad is getting left in 2022. #ByeeeeeByeBYeBirrrrrrrrrdie

They didn't win. They only think they won

I didn't know it was my job to be a comedian when I can't even read the crowd anymore due to how much time has passed

Still hungry, sushi wasn't very filling. Sushi buffet would've been better you're right
