When going to Popeye's becomes a whole day adventure exploring the National Guard base and Hwy 101 along the CA coast to Carlsbad to get Jeni's ice cream. Then you barely make it to ur 8p ride to praise practice at VR bc of ordering pizza at Pauly's Pizza Joint. Also I barely got to do any hw bc of the adventures and playing PvZ2 and beating the Lost City boss and watching berleezy Res Evil village. Then ping pong practice at night with lobs and trying to get backhand and loop more consistent

First time on praise since Super Bowl Sunday

Quiet study hall. This isn't awkward at all.

Burned all my pencil lead and nearly all my paper. Was in the classroom until 11p finishing M171A HW6.
You don't know how many Quadratinis and jolly ranchers I ate (I'm going insane)

Super chill day, watched a lot of berleezy and CoryxKenshin. Slept around 4 hrs, then went to DT, came back and napped until afternoon. Got some groceries, had ramen and porkchop for dinner. Also played some more ping pong

Today was more productive than almost all of last week. Learning about cholinergic and opioid receptors as well as the 1995 Aum Cult sarin gas attack in Tokyo and the Sackler family's "blood money" from opioids and then donating to academic institutions had me scanning slides and holding on to every word Prof Devaraj was saying. Talk about food for thought.

More Turing Machines, halting problem, computability and reductions oh boy

Classical music is growing on me.

Have I mentioned how it's slightly annoying that some people detest anything that isn't familiar to them, like Western or Latin American cuisine? Like cmon bruh, then how am I supposed to get good asian food like sushi, ramen, pho, KBBQ, hot pot, or authentic Chinese food? Oh well. Heck, it's not even that. Some Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine would go a long way.

Oranges, Raisin Bran Crunch, and toast = S-tier breakfast at home. Pancakes and French toast take the cake at diners. Also who orders toast at diners, isn't that what toasters are for?

Only slept 4 hrs last night bc I had a nap from 5 to 8. Randomly decided to check out webtoons again and Rebirth (the super awesome comic about the zombie apocalypse and the dad (Noah) who can control blood and whose son can store objects in earrings) is on pause. I'm like relax with the heat bruh, I like a good story but this is getting more complicated then I thought.

Super hungry rn. Also guess how much an EKG was gonna cost me yesterday? $69!! I'm like nah bruh. Today is the final followup appointment with Student Health as far as I know. Panda Express is kinda getting old so I think I'll go with a Subway footlong and raspberry cheesecake cookie today.

Disturbed by what I heard from the front desk of dispatch just now. Trust me, you don't wanna know.

Guess we're gonna be learning a whole lot about orbits and stablizers today. Only one pickup scheduled for 10:20, so we got some time. The morning relaxation at the station is rather nice, actually. Listening to lofi or classical and journaling or watching some YouTube

HOLY COW I FORGOT HOW GRIPPING THE STORY FOR REBIRTH IS. THANK YOU 69MICHI!!

Where did Tuesday go? I only had 5 hr 50 min of sleep and wanted to nap after lunch ($15 Chicken Tikka Masala rice plate combo w/ Naan). Some part of me that's almost irrationally driven to do wild things decided why not just stay at FAH for almost 3 full hrs after doing DT. The funny thing is, I wasn't that tired and being in the shade kind of helped. There were these large crows jumping around near me which made me slightly uneasy. FAH is actually quite comfortable. The dimensional difference is huge between our makeshift ping pong table and an actual table. I was getting beat by Ryan even though he wasn't using the standard moves like loop, chop, push, since he returns super quick and can reach the ball without moving too much. But in a real game, the table is so large that there's always at least one corner you can hit to where the guy can't readily reach. The table is large enough that you simply cannot be everywhere all at once.

I'll probably nap after my shift today. Apparently desktop Spotify doesn't like NordVPN bc as soon as I turned it off, Spotify worked as normal. Got added in for a 7:50 pickup and I'm like I kind of thought this would be a peaceful morning shift but yes I love unexpected pickups, thanks bruh ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜‘
