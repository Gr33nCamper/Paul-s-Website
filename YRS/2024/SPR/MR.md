When going to Popeye's becomes a whole day adventure exploring the National Guard base and Hwy 101 along the CA coast to Carlsbad to get Jeni's ice cream. Then you barely make it to ur 8p ride to praise practice at VR bc of ordering pizza at Pauly's Pizza Joint. Also I barely got to do any hw bc of the adventures and playing PvZ2 and beating the Lost City boss and watching iBerleezy Res Evil village. Then ping pong practice at night with lobs and trying to get backhand and loop more consistent.

Quiet study hall. This isn't awkward at all.
