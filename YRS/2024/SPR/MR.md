When going to Popeye's becomes a whole day adventure exploring the National Guard base and Hwy 101 along the CA coast to Carlsbad to get Jeni's ice cream. Then you barely make it to ur 8p ride to praise practice at VR bc of ordering pizza at Pauly's Pizza Joint. Also I barely got to do any hw bc of the adventures and playing PvZ2 and beating the Lost City boss and watching berleezy RE8. Then ping pong practice at night with lobs and trying to get backhand and loop more consistent

First time on praise since Super Bowl Sunday

Quiet study hall. This isn't awkward at all.

Burned all my pencil lead and nearly all my paper. Was in the classroom until 11p finishing M171A HW6.
You don't know how many Quadratinis and jolly ranchers I ate (I'm going insane)

Super chill day, watched a lot of berleezy and CoryxKenshin. Slept around 4 hrs, then went to DT, came back and napped until afternoon. Got some groceries, had ramen and porkchop for dinner. Also played some more ping pong

Today was more productive than almost all of last week. Learning about cholinergic and opioid receptors as well as the 1995 Aum Cult sarin gas attack in Tokyo and the Sackler family's "blood money" from opioids and then donating to academic institutions had me scanning slides and holding on to every word Prof Devaraj was saying. Talk about food for thought.

More Turing Machines, halting problem, computability and reductions oh boy

Classical music is growing on me.

Have I mentioned how it's slightly annoying that some people detest anything that isn't familiar to them, like Western or Latin American cuisine? Like cmon bruh, how am I supposed to get good asian food like sushi, ramen, pho, KBBQ, hot pot, or authentic Sichuanese food? Oh well. Heck, it's not even that. Some Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine would go a long way.

Oranges, Raisin Bran Crunch, and toast = S-tier breakfast at home. Pancakes and French toast take the cake at diners. Also who orders toast at diners, isn't that what toasters are for?

Only slept 4 hrs last night bc I had a nap from 5 to 8. Randomly decided to check out webtoons again and Rebirth (the super awesome comic about the zombie apocalypse and the dad (Noah) who can control blood and whose son can store objects in earrings) is on pause. I'm like relax with the heat bruh, I like a good story but this is getting more complicated then I thought.

Super hungry rn. Also guess how much an EKG was gonna cost me yesterday? $69!! I'm like nah bruh. Today is the final followup appointment with Student Health as far as I know. Panda Express is kinda getting old so I think I'll go with a Subway footlong and raspberry cheesecake cookie today.

Disturbed by what I heard from the front desk of dispatch just now. Trust me, you don't wanna know.

Guess we're gonna be learning a whole lot about orbits and stablizers today. Only one pickup scheduled for 10:20, so we got some time. The morning relaxation at the station is rather nice, actually. Listening to lofi or classical and journaling or watching some YouTube

HOLY COW I FORGOT HOW GRIPPING THE STORY FOR REBIRTH IS. THANK YOU 69MICHI!!

Where did Tuesday go? I only had 5 hr 50 min of sleep and wanted to nap after lunch ($15 Chicken Tikka Masala rice plate combo w/ Naan). Some part of me that's almost irrationally driven to do wild things decided why not just stay at FAH for almost 3 full hrs after doing DT. The funny thing is, I wasn't that tired and being in the shade kind of helped. There were these large crows jumping around near me which made me slightly uneasy. FAH is actually quite comfortable. The dimensional difference is huge between our makeshift ping pong table and an actual table. I was getting beat by Ryan even though he wasn't using the standard moves like loop, chop, push, since he returns super quick and can reach the ball without moving too much. But in a real game, the table is so large that there's always at least one corner you can hit to where the guy can't readily reach. The table is large enough that you simply cannot be everywhere all at once.

I'll probably nap after my shift today. Apparently desktop Spotify doesn't like NordVPN bc as soon as I turned it off, Spotify worked as normal. Got added in for a 7:50 pickup and I'm like I kind of thought this would be a peaceful morning shift but yes I love unexpected pickups, thanks bruh üò¨üòë

More unexpected morning relief pickups #SMH. And during the first 2 minutes of my shift too. U kno how many hrs I slept last night? 5hr 23m. So I'm gonna be napping after my shift ends. Probably eat some cereal and then ... Hold up I still need to go to the M184 discussion at 5p. So at minimum, I need to be up by 4p.

Luckily, only two pickups today and one of them is James so it's just a casual workshift (hopefully, unless there are like 5 other unexpected relief pickups). And the windows had so much condensation on them too like u can't be serious bruh. Had to manually wipe the rearview mirrors with the one Panda Express napkin in my pocket. Tbh I just wanted to listen to some chill spring lofi and maybe read some Webtoons and watch the University Challenge quiz show from the UK but then some pesky relief pickups happened. No bother

How do U think I'm supposed to react when someone explicitly mentions how they feel attracted to married women who are also your mentors and dip on plans with u bc of chasing after females? And then when you invite them to TFNs he always sits in the way back and never stays for the whole thing like what's up with that. People in our church are not monsters and you're not gonna get stabbed. Sometimes you need to be a man. U see the pattern with this guy? These are his decisions, but I don't necessarily approve of all of them.

I mean, I don't really care if the freshmen think I'm weird bc first of all they don't know all of my history and secondly I'm not trying to impress them.

University Challenge Quiz show is almost 100% like Quiz bowl it might be my new favorite thing to watch. Can't believe some team didn't get Faraday within the first clue when they mentioned a constant used to describe the charge of 1 mol of electrons.

Shamrock shake ‚òòÔ∏è and Leprechaun Lemonade woohoo!

Lots of ping pong today and also some more bereleezy RE8 and Pongfinity on Youtube. Also washed white towel and knocked out three problems for M171A final hw

Cuba < 1 wk away. Found out about the 7p dinner at Vasquez residence by mere coincidence asking Dave about the Zoom recording and apparently there's a GroupMe chat. American dinner of pork loin, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and oven roasted veggies was fire. 

Vons ran out of Canada Dry Fruit Splash.

Glider study lounge is apparently what the space above RS is called. Was surprisingly productive there and played pool at RIMAC after with some Josh, James, Linus, and Gideon

You know what spring makes me think of? American suburbia in the 1950s aka little boxes on the hillside made of ticky tacky (2019 APUSH exam anyone?) Sometimes I wish I could just drive east to see the green grass, blooming flowers, and trees of the American southeastern states like Kentucky and Arkansas. But since it's super far, that's not something I can readily see. Sunny days look way better than gloomy ones. Got Brothers Family restaurant earlier today and napped for like 1 hr 20 min before I hurriedly watched a discussion video and took the bus to campus for CS105 Final. Part 1 was TOO EASY but Part 2 was thorny.

Saw the sun shining through the window for the first time since last April, what joy filled my heart at that moment!

Almost sent an email about a conflict with a TT shift and a final on June 10, but I realized I can just put that shift on the tradeboard when the time comes.

Anyways, back to work

Was almost the victim of identity theft today bc I misplaced my wallet. And I found out at the worst possible time, which is after the Math 171A final since they wanted to see ID cards after, but luckily they also accepted the digital ID card. Searched around campus, retracing steps. Turns out it had just fallen out of my pocket while I was driving Cart 0721 and I happened to think of that possibility when I was telling Sebastian. Praise the Lord!!

Gap day. I'll probably nap after my shift ends. Just another three hours or so. Just making a compiled slide deck of all the 2nd half of the Chm168 material to use for tomorrow's midterm. 

It's really foggy this morning. 7:20 might be my earliest pickup so far

KP4 and Cane's Pt2 will happen soon enough relax bruh

Watched some CoryxKenshin COD zombies and Black OPs III gameplay, I could vicariously feel the pressure as waves kept coming and there were runners and super zombies. Ended up taking a nap around 3p and getting up at almost 6p but I was refreshed. Lemongrass chicken bento from Trip and Kathleen was delicious.

LET'S GOOOOO. LAST SHIFT OF WI24. GOOD RIDDANCE TO THESE EARLY MORNING SHIFTS. THEY WON'T BE MISSED.

I'd rather not have someone chew me out when I'm late as if that's the only that should matter to me in my life. I acknowledge I messed up however I don't know if you're aware, but I happen to care about quite a few other things besides my Triton Transit job. But I'll still try to get up earlier next quarter. And maybe I'll just go to Geisel. Actually, that's probably not gonna happen on Mondays and Fridays since my shifts are at 9a. But having peaceful morning time is great. And I'd enjoy them a lot more when I can do DT at those hours and then listen to chill lofi piano or guitar w/o having to be pestered for relief pickups like please no bruh. Just ask someone else.

Good news is today I don't have any pickups. So I'm hoping I won't get bothered by more than two or three relief pickups or random duties like refueling. Best case scenario is that they don't ask me to do anything for 4 hrs which would be awesome since I didn't feel like doing anything anyway. But that's unlikely. One can still hope though

Am I gonna look back on WI24 and laugh one day? I hardly attended lectures and stayed inside a lot more since there were many days with dreadful weather (heavy rain) and I napped more. Also RE8 and ping pong provided indoor entertainment. Ok a little bit of PvZ2 and PG also but that was earlier on. Tbh, I think this quarter would have been more enjoyable if I had worked fewer days. M171A was really hard to get at first, but then I found out it's just a lot of linear algebra and adding fractions which aren't difficult, but rather easy to mess up on. I mean, did U see how many times I had to check intermediate steps for the Simplex Method for finding an optimizer for the sLP on the Final? But when you get the sum right though?? I'm like OOOOHWEEE (to quote Cory). The combination of being crunched for time plus the quarter moving by so fast meant it was just hw asgmt after hw asgmt, shift after shift, weekend after weekend, retreat after retreat, with very little to break up the monotony. And any break I got didn't exactly feel long enough. Add on top of that that I couldn't shake the feeling that so much more was expected of me after baptism and being a senior and all so fellowship times, TFN, DIVE, and SWS all got me feeling more on edge since I didn't want to set a bad example or get scolded. I legitimately felt like my every move was being watched. But that kind of stifled my personality a lot. If I could have just had a personal trip somewhere in the woods to retreat that would have been so helpful actually. Alas, I don't own a vehicle so the closest equivalent is HC 3 hr loops and being alone in the electric cart listening to music on speaker.

At least that's one good thing about working at Triton Transit though. At the station, I don't really see people from our church too often so I get a short break. Phew! It's funny how I didn't truly appreciate all those little solo adventures like taking the train back home or going to Louisiana or going to Riverside by FlixBus or walking to Lake Elizabeth on Thanksgiving Day until now when I hardly have chances to go anywhere or do anything alone.

Only one relief dropoff today so far. Found out that the UK flag üá¨üáß (aka Union Jack) has a proper orientation, so the thick white stripe has to be along the top left on the top and along the side at the bottom, if the flag pole is on the left.

COMPLETED LAST SHIFT OF WI24 ü´°üò§

NO MORE EARLY MORNING SHIFTS. BYEEEEEEEEEEEEE BYE BYE BIRRRRRRRRRRRDIE

M184 Final was considerably harder than the midterm, but I got answers that I feel confident in based on what I knew to be true to the best of my knowledge. It's oddly relaxing when you're alone taking an exam and you're checking answers with extra time. I almost never leave exam rooms early since it's like why would I give up free time to check if my answers are correct? I made the mistake of being overconfident for my Chm40a final my first quarter and ever since then unless I'm absolutely stumped and no amount of extra time can help me figure something out like for Chm114c where you gotta know what the book said or else it's anyone's guess if your answer is right.

At last, WI24 is over. First time I've been relieved that a quarter is over, since I usually wish it could be longer since it's like that feeling of reaching the end of the road and being like now what? Or like when you finish reading a book. You've been on an awesome journey but your next steps are up to you. We're never gonna be in those lecture halls again and it felt kind of like an adventure.

But not this quarter. I was ready to be done with this quarter. Sports and bonfire was quite refreshing. Especially since we got some Banh Mi. I'll head to bed soon
