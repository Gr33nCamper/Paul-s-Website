When going to Popeye's becomes a whole day adventure exploring the National Guard base and Hwy 101 along the CA coast to Carlsbad to get Jeni's ice cream. Then you barely make it to ur 8p ride to praise practice at VR bc of ordering pizza at Pauly's Pizza Joint. Also I barely got to do any hw bc of the adventures and playing PvZ2 and beating the Lost City boss and watching berleezy Res Evil village. Then ping pong practice at night with lobs and trying to get backhand and loop more consistent

Quiet study hall. This isn't awkward at all.

Burned all my pencil lead and nearly all my paper. Was in the classroom until 11p finishing M171A HW6.
You don't know how many Quadratinis and jolly ranchers I ate (I was losing my sanity)

Super chill day, watched a lot of berleezy and CoryxKenshin. Slept around 4 hrs, then went to DT, came back and napped until afternoon. Got some groceries, had ramen and porkchop for dinner. Also played some more ping pong.

Today was more productive than almost all of last week. Learning about cholinergic and opioid receptors as well as the 1995 Aum Cult sarin gas attack in Tokyo and the Sackler family's "blood money" from opioids and then donating to academic institutions had me scanning slides and holding on to every word Prof Devaraj was saying. Talk about food for thought.

More Turing Machines, halting problem, computability and reductions oh boy

Classical music is growing on me.

Have I mentioned how it's slightly annoying that some people detest anything that isn't familiar to them, like Western or Latin American cuisine? Like cmon bruh, then how am I supposed to get good asian food like sushi, ramen, pho, KBBQ, hot pot, or authentic Chinese food? Oh well. Heck, it's not even that. Some Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine would go a long way.

Oranges, Raisin Bran Crunch, and toast = S-tier breakfast at home. Pancakes and French toast take the cake at diners. Also who orders toast at diners, isn't that what toasters are for?
