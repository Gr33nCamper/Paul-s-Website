When going to Popeye's becomes a whole day adventure exploring the National Guard base and Hwy 101 along the CA coast to Carlsbad to get Jeni's ice cream. Then you barely make it to ur 8p ride to praise practice at VR bc of ordering pizza at Pauly's Pizza Joint. Also I barely got to do any hw bc of the adventures and playing PvZ2 and beating the Lost City boss and watching berleezy Res Evil village. Then ping pong practice at night with lobs and trying to get backhand and loop more consistent.

Quiet study hall. This isn't awkward at all.

Burned all my pencil lead and nearly all my paper. Was in the classroom until 11p finishing M171A HW6.
You don't know how many Quadratinis and jolly ranchers I ate. (I was losing my sanity)

Today was more productive than almost all of last week. Learning about cholinergic and opioid receptors as well as the 1995 Aum Cult sarin gas attack in Tokyo and the Sackler family's "blood money" from opioids and then donating to academic institutions had me scanning slides and holding on to every word Prof Devaraj was saying. Talk about food for thought.

More Turing Machines, halting problem, computability and reductions oh boy
