I had another weird dream last night. Basically I had to escape a killer Chica animatronic with glowing eyes that was eating kids and the first level wasn't too bad because it was just hiding but the second level was WAY harder bc we had to do parkour and there were these ladders which didn't look like they extended super high until you jumped on them. As the crowd got thinner and thinner, I realized the best method would be to escape, so I made it out of the building's open window and climbed on the roof. Then somehow I got rescued and ended up in a parking lot with Ed. Apparently, he talked to some guy driving a bus/delivery vehicle and he was like "I got you guys" and we got a free ride. He was speaking either a Slavic or Middle Eastern language but he looked white and had long brown hair. The seats were super cramped though and I had trouble getting in. But then I spotted a more spacious seat where you could let your feet rest on top of the super cramped seat. Then a wahman was asking if Ed and I had plans for a road trip and I was like nah, there's not really time for that next year. But then she kept asking and I got annoyed.

This was my annual random perusal of IG and FB and I made a few profile and cover pic updates and ended up looking at pics from the past from other people's profiles. In a historical way, looking into a window of the past. Different times, different culture. Nowadays, kids don't post on each other's timelines. What do they do? Send each other TikToks? I'm like cob.

That feeling when your only time to be able to even work through your own thoughts and emotions is at work...ðŸ˜”. And over break you've been traveling so long trying to find peace and time to think. On trains, planes, cars, and all that, you've been trying to think most about what's important, but really it's more like you're trying to leave something behind.  

Reading some of my old writing assessment stories from 4th grade were pretty entertaining. In fact, we could probably do something like that rn. Just kidding, I'd need to freestyle something on the fly. Or make it based on what's happening right now. You can't rush deep reflective thoughts. It takes time, let it flow. 

Forgot I left my sunglasses in the pocket of my jacket at home. Also the bike cable lock. So I'll bike back after this and bus back for CS105, catch my breath for an hour and then go to M184 lecture and M171a discussion (those are mandatory). Think I'll do some video editing at work from now on when things get dull. So much footage to work with. And editing to experiment with.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I'm 34% in sleep debt. Alameda Sr Retreat was engaging but also I wish I had stocked up more sleep beforehand because the plenary sessions started feeling like I was getting flooded with content and I didn't have much mental energy. Plus, I wanted to sleep earlier but you know how a lot of those night time hangouts are where the interesting things are brought up. And the earliest sleep time is kind of dependent on when the group wraps up because it's not like you're gonna crawl in your sleeping bag while the lights are on and people are hanging out. Evenings are also the only time we can interact with our hosts. 

I only slept 4 and a half hrs last night and my balance is 5h 15m. I only have two nights to catch up on sleep, because Fri night is probably at most 8 hrs bc of TFN and getting up at 8a. But those HAVE to be before winter retreat because if I'm going in there with that little sleep in the bank, I'm not gonna be able to get much out of it despite having every intention to engage with the messages. Father, I only need enough energy to get to the next refuel station.

Solo trips seem a lot more appealing now. But maybe I don't want to be driving for super long alone. Unless it's in a place with lots of trees and nature. Not a windy mountain road.

First time picking up passenger on HC, realized I had been missing one stop on the loop for the past two times bc the route changed since the time Sam showed me what the route was. ðŸ˜…

Was falling asleep in CS105 lecture. Gideon might have to hand off da iClicker to Josh tonight. I considered skipping M184 lecture and M171A discussion and just napping from 3p to 6a tomorrow but I was like nah I'm already here. Ate some curry pork rice from TapEx with a Coca-cola. Dr. Pepper is better than I remembered bc I was downing it like nobody's business at McDonald's last night with James Lee.

Got around 8 and a half hrs of sleep last night, but I still felt slightly tired. It's ok, the sleep debt got cut by ~10%. Also, I only got two pickups and there's a sizeable gap in between so I reckon I could get some BK before heading back w/o raising suspicion.

Yesterday there were so many times my head almost fell straight forward and hit my desk in lecture bc I was so tired. Not even water and gum chewing helped, so at the end I started doing the eye-scanning thing they teach us in Triton Transit so that you're prepared if someone or something unexpectedly pops out of the side of the road and I think that helped. Also in the M171a discussion, I was writing down all the stuff as quickly as possible and taking pics of the board even though most of it wasn't even super difficult or novel bc I wanted to keep myself occupied to not get bored and fall asleep. And the room was warm even when I took off my jacket.

Was super lost in deep thought about my existence and the purpose of my life earlier this afternoon as the instrumental and backing vocals of "Tuesday" by Drake and iLoveMakonnen reverberated through my head via mental radio. Walking between class, going down steps, seeing the crisp red leaves on the American sweetgums.

Wow, first time staying in Geisel until closing time this year.

Before I forget, what I would like to be addressed about during Winter Retreat is not simply doubling down on the idea of taking joy in suffering (as Christ did on the cross so that suffering like he did, we will certainly resurrect as he did), but rather how to anchor myself in God's Word and have faith through storms of life. Actually that's a bit too generic if you ask me because I already know what the answer to that will be: practice praying and reading the Bible more consistently.

What I'm taking into retreat is this: How do I daily lay down my arms and relinquish control of my life to God? If I want to live a life that is well-spent, giving everything I have so that even in the face of death, I would not be afraid of what's next, what does that look like?
