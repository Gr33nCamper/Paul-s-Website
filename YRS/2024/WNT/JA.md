I had another weird dream last night. Basically I had to escape a killer Chica animatronic with glowing eyes that was eating kids and the first level wasn't too bad because it was just hiding but the second level was WAY harder bc we had to do parkour and there were these ladders which didn't look like they extended super high until you jumped on them. As the crowd got thinner and thinner, I realized the best method would be to escape, so I made it out of the building's open window and climbed on the roof. Then somehow I got rescued and ended up in a parking lot with Ed. Apparently, he talked to some guy driving a bus/delivery vehicle and he was like "I got you guys" and we got a free ride. He was speaking either a Slavic or middle eastern language but he looked white and had long brown hair. The seats were super cramped though and I had trouble getting in. But then I spotted a more spacious seat where you could let your feet rest on top of the super cramped seat. Then a wahman was asking if Ed and I had plans for a road trip and I was like nah, there's not really time for that next year. But then she kept asking and I got annoyed.

This was my annual random perusal of IG and FB and I made a few profile and cover pic updates and ended up looking at pics from the past from other people's profiles. In a historical way, looking into a window of the past. Different times, different culture. Nowadays, kids don't post on each other's timelines. What do they do? Send each other TikToks? I'm like cob.
