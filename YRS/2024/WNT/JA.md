I had another weird dream last night. Basically I had to escape a killer Chica animatronic with glowing eyes that was eating kids and the first level wasn't too bad because it was just hiding but the second level was WAY harder bc we had to do parkour and there were these ladders which didn't look like they extended super high until you jumped on them. As the crowd got thinner and thinner, I realized the best method would be to escape, so I made it out of the building's open window and climbed on the roof. Then somehow I got rescued and ended up in a parking lot with Ed. Apparently, he talked to some guy driving a bus/delivery vehicle and he was like "I got you guys" and we got a free ride. He was speaking either a Slavic or Middle Eastern language but he looked white and had long brown hair. The seats were super cramped though and I had trouble getting in. But then I spotted a more spacious seat where you could let your feet rest on top of the super cramped seat. Then a wahman was asking if Ed and I had plans for a road trip and I was like nah, there's not really time for that next year. But then she kept asking and I got annoyed.

This was my annual random perusal of IG and FB and I made a few profile and cover pic updates and ended up looking at pics from the past from other people's profiles. In a historical way, looking into a window of the past. Different times, different culture. Kids don't post on each other's timelines anymore.

That feeling when your only time to be able to even work through your own thoughts and emotions is at work...ðŸ˜”. And over break you've been traveling so long trying to find peace and time to think. On trains, planes, cars, and all that, you've been trying to think most about what's important, but it's more like trying to leave something behind.  

Reading some of my old writing assessment stories from 4th grade were pretty entertaining. In fact, we could probably do something like that rn. Just kidding, I'd need to freestyle something on the fly. Or make it based on what's happening right now. You can't rush deep reflective thoughts. It takes time, let it flow. 

Forgot I left my sunglasses in the pocket of my jacket at home. Also the bike cable lock. So I'll bike back after this and bus back for CS105, catch my breath for an hour and then go to M184 lecture and M171a discussion (those are mandatory). Think I'll do some video editing at work from now on when things get dull. So much footage to work with. And editing to experiment with.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I'm 34% in sleep debt. Alameda Sr Retreat was engaging but also I wish I had stocked up more sleep beforehand because the plenary sessions started feeling like I was getting flooded with content and I didn't have much mental energy. Plus, I wanted to sleep earlier but you know how a lot of those night time hangouts are where the interesting things are brought up. And the earliest sleep time is kind of dependent on when the group wraps up because it's not like you're gonna crawl in your sleeping bag while the lights are on and people are hanging out. Evenings are also the only time we can interact with our hosts. 

I only slept 4 and a half hrs last night and my balance is 5h 15m. I only have two nights to catch up on sleep, because Fri night is probably at most 8 hrs bc of TFN and getting up at 8a. But those HAVE to be before winter retreat because if I'm going in there with that little sleep in the bank, I'm not gonna be able to get much out of it despite having every intention to engage with the messages. Father, I only need enough energy to get to the next refuel station.

Solo trips seem a lot more appealing now. But maybe I don't want to be driving for super long alone. Unless it's in a place with lots of trees and nature. Not a windy mountain road.

First time picking up passenger on HC, realized I had been missing one stop on the loop for the past two times bc the route changed since the time Sam showed me what the route was. ðŸ˜…

Was falling asleep in CS105 lecture. Gideon might have to hand off da iClicker to Josh tonight. I considered skipping M184 lecture and M171A discussion and just napping from 3p to 6a tomorrow but I was like nah I'm already here. Ate some curry pork rice from TapEx with a Coca-cola. Dr. Pepper is better than I remembered bc I was downing it like nobody's business at McDonald's last night with James Lee.

Got around 8 and a half hrs of sleep last night, but I still felt slightly tired. It's ok, the sleep debt got cut by ~10%. Also, I only got two pickups and there's a sizeable gap in between so I reckon I could get some BK before heading back w/o raising suspicion.

Yesterday there were so many times my head almost fell straight forward and hit my desk in lecture bc I was so tired. Not even water and gum chewing helped, so at the end I started doing the eye-scanning thing they teach us in Triton Transit so that you're prepared if someone or something unexpectedly pops out of the side of the road and I think that helped. Also in the M171a discussion, I was writing down all the stuff as quickly as possible and taking pics of the board even though most of it wasn't even super difficult or novel bc I wanted to keep myself occupied to not get bored and fall asleep. And the room was warm even when I took off my jacket.

Was super lost in deep thought about my existence and the purpose of my life earlier this afternoon as the instrumental and backing vocals of "Tuesday" by Drake and iLoveMakonnen reverberated through my head via mental radio. Walking between class, going down steps, seeing the crisp red leaves on the American sweetgums.

Wow, first time staying in Geisel until closing time this year.

Before I forget, what I would like to be addressed about during Winter Retreat is not simply doubling down on the idea of taking joy in suffering (as Christ did on the cross so that suffering like he did, we will certainly resurrect as he did), but rather how to anchor myself in God's Word and have faith through storms of life. Actually that's a bit too generic if you ask me because I already know what the answer to that will be: practice praying and reading the Bible more consistently.

What I'm taking into retreat is this: How do I daily lay down my arms and relinquish control of my life to God? If I want to live a life that is well-spent, giving everything I have so that even in the face of death, I would not be afraid of what's next, what does that look like?

How is Jan more than halfway done? Retreat was a blur. Everything's racing by. I'm just trying to collect my thoughts. Seems like these days I hardly get a chance to do so. Even though it's not the dreaded block schedule from last quarter, I don't have so much time that it's so easy to find a block of time for thinking but also prayer and Scripture reading (but you see we need to know where we are to know how to get to where we should be).

Late for work today. Bummer. I was up briefly at like 7:20 but then I went back to bed and didn't get up until 9a which is when my shift starts. Luckily, Sebastian was generous enough to send me to the station on short notice. 

Lack of sleep is seriously not a minor handicap. It completely derails my mental capacity and heavily affects my irritability. Can't believe I used to stay up until 3 or 4 in the morning doing meaningless activities and getting up around noon (soph and a lot of jr year). Wish someone told me getting up early isn't necessarily being tryhard but trying to make the most use out of your time and more in sync with our biological clock rhythm.

Crap, CS105 hw due in two days.

Two points general violation at work for being 30 min late. COB.

I had a conversation with a follower of Islam on Library walk. He was saying stuff like how God would save his prophets and if Jesus was His son, he wouldn't let him die. Also he was saying that sin is not punished with death and that Allah loves to forgive so all you need to do is repent. Taking the C.S. Lewis approach from _Mere Christianity_, there's a lot from Islam that is correct, I don't have to dismiss everything. But where it differs from Christianity, Chrisitianity must be correct and it must be wrong.

Gonna do some DT. For the first time in a long time. Time to reconnect with my Heavenly Father.

Isn't it funny how the things which mattered so much to me when I was younger really mean nothing now.

I'm kind of curious to see my old journal entries bc if they were like tweets then there could be some really funny remarks but also it could be super cringe bc I was like 17/18. Currently at work, but this is the short shift. Foot traffic was surprisingly heavier than I thought at 9:50.

Yesterday's rain was quite nice. I know a lot of Californians don't like the rain but I like rain and cloudy weather interspersed between sunny days to prevent monotony. If it's a whole string of them, then it's a little gloomy. But if I had to choose between rain and cloudy weather, I'd pick rain because the sound of rain is quite calming and also the air is way fresher afterwards. For cloudy days, the whole sky looks the same the whole day.

When the senior group chat fr just became a place where people say happy birthday instead of planning fellowship. #Bruh

Fleeing temptations and tracing them back to the root of unbelief takes serious work. The push-up method works quite well though for fighting passions of my former ignorance. I call it "Fighting mental exhaustion by physical exertion".

Alright I actually need to catch up on M184 lectures and start HW2. Can't miss this Friday's Book Club or Friday lunch DT.

Decided to skip the Chem 168 lecture today because it's hard for me to pay attention anyways, might as well work on assignments and catch up on lectures in the meantime.

I'm mad. What happened was I parked the shuttle for about an hour at the KOP loop and watched YouTube. I was kind of hoping they wouldn't notice, but I guess either I got reported or they viewed the cam. Part of me is mad at myself because I thought I was so clever as to get away with it when it was for that long. Another part of me is angry with TT for making rules like how we can't miss stops. But that rule isn't unreasonable. It's just me when I'm angry not being able to evaluate my actions objectively.

I have a love hate relationship with justice. Because although my innermost being is satisfied when justice is served, like when the general from RRR and his wife died or criminals get what they deserve, I often protest when I'm getting punished. It's hard not to have bias since self-love kicks in and I'm so quick to come up with an excuse for myself. When I take a stab from the blade of justice, it feels a lot different.

I was in PC earlier and thought I could go in my usual spot with the couches against the wall outside the theater. But we had to move bc someone said there was an event. Made a whole loop around PC and now I'm in Geisel. To be honest, I kind of just wanna forget about the whole thing that just happened at work. Hopefully I don't get suspended. But if I do, then I gotta take it like a man. And in the future, I'll make sure I keep looping at least 12 times around the Health Campus in 3 hrs. 

You know what's really dumb? Triton Transit doesn't even let you take personal videos in the UCSD vehicles. So I guess I'll have to cut out the cart driving scenes if I upload videos to YouTube. But otherwise, I'll keep the personal footage bc what are they gonna do about it?

Feeling hungry but the line for Panda Express was insane. Think I'll wait a little longer for the line to thin. But it's starting to gnaw away at me. I'll head out by 1p.

I'll have to talk to Victor tomorrow. It's no doubt going to be about today's incident.
Well, if he wants to fire me, he can go ahead and fire me. If it's suffering for what I did, then there's nothing to boast about and nothing more to be said. I'm not afraid to face consequences.

Mental note: Don't try to finesse the system again anytime soon. Just do your duties and lay low okay? We don't want to get fired for something that was completely avoidable.

Okay, actually Triton Transit was supposed to be the backup plan if I didn't get employed by end of SP24 so it would kinda sorta maybe probably be nice to still be working for them at that time haha ðŸ˜…

That's what I get for not living out Christian morality as described in _Mere Christianity_ where C.S. Lewis says that it's not about what we do, but a certain quality of character since a bad tennis player can sometimes hit good shots, but that doesn't make him a good player. Meanwhile a good tennis player "... is the man whose eye and muscles and nerves have been so trained by making innumerable good shots that they can now be relied on. They have a certain tone or quality which is there even when he is not playing, just as a mathematician's mind has a certain habit and outlook which is there even when he is not doing mathematics" (C.S. Lewis Book III, Ch.2).

Good news! I didn't get fired. But I did get another violation point. Another one and I get suspended.

No more excuses. I'll just focus on doing the best job possible. Toe the line. In fact, I'll take another look at the updated HC route. Winter chill lofi is really great for calming down.

Seems like here is one of the few places I can openly talk about how I'm feeling. Senior year has subverted 99% of my expectations. Even though my expectations were kinda vague. Ok, maybe they were a bit more specific than I'd like to admit. I thought we as seniors would be in actual leadership positions. And that TFNs would continue. And how we'd have more senior hangouts. But really it's been like the staff have just been encouraging organically formed relationships. Guess what? I'm so inept at socializing w/o shock factor or acting weird. And even DT stuff has been not as organized. I'm like come on man. It's been hard to bond with the younger guys. It's gonna sound so dumb when I say it but one of my biggest fears is that they're gonna think I'm corny as heck when I show my true personality.

I don't know, I think I overall expected senior year to have more handholding and structure to follow but they're like we give you the abstract data type and now it's up to you to implement it and I'm like forget you this is so vague and isn't this a really high bar? 

Seems like summer before senior year was a good gauge for how senior year would be like. A lot of people are doing their own thing (To be fair that's been me partly also. I mean come on, I'd be lying if I said I just absolutely LOVE hanging out with my apartment mates all the time. Do you know how annoying some of them can be? Like brother, you thought the road trip was just to see trees?? Yes but also to escape those guys like golly can I get even a single breath of air alone? ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡) At least four people in our class have fallen away in attendance. But maybe all we need is a catalyst to organize events.

And since when did the sr group chat become a place for only saying happy birthday? I mean, heck, at this rate we might as well make a whole separate chat just for that. Call it "Senior Bday Regards" or something. Like, these guys fr have me scrolling past miles of this just to see where we're going to meet at for something. Not to mention all the lurkers like I know we said we wouldn't cut you guys off but something still peeves me about having so many inactive members like when you have a hash table but it's super memory inefficient since you have so many unallocated slots just to avoid collisions. So you have super fast lookup but in reality you're only using like 10% of the slots.

I talked to Bryan yesterday about him being super loud in the office and he gave the expected bullcrap about how we were watching the 49ers game (as if that makes it okay to scream in the office) and how he doesn't think we're studying (I guess someone doesn't have eyes) and if he had more time, I bet he'd probably say something like how in HIS eyes HE'S not even being that loud (guess what buddy you don't own the office), blah blah blah blah just shut up bruh (trust me guys, I know what it's like to have a loud roommate whose idea of a fun time is playing video games with friends on discord like #GetALife #GetReal #UrNotAsCoolAsUThink. Just read some of my older journal entries and you'll find a half dozen of those about Casper).

You know how forgiveness is saying that your relationship with someone means more to you than the wrong they did to you? Well, I'll tell you honestly that the relationship with Bryan was not even the first thing on my mind when I was telling him that because it was just using logic and a calmer voice to see if he would take it seriously or just make some flippant remark like "ok" as if that's gonna make me want to cut you some slack.

It's unseasonably warm up here on the 7th floor like do they not have any AC or what. First time here since summer. 69ÂºF in late Jan come on bruh. It could be worse though. Summer I was dying. Especially when people in my apartment think stuffy = comfortable. #StopTheCap.

Pretty view from the near top of Geisel. Sunny days. Winter chill guitar. Peace.

You know what else is peaceful? Not having to deal with annoying people. Like roommates. Especially if they put in 0 effort to improve. And then I have to keep dying just to keep a relationship alive. Like at some point you start wondering what's even worth it. Some arguments aren't even worth having just because I only have so much energy. But is this what makes relationships so hard? If Bryan is a gift from God, then I suppose his primary role is to test the absolute crap out of all of our patiences and for me to not explode in a rage-filled fit when he provokes me.

I'm done faking. If someone is making me feel uncomfortable, I'll just outright say "This is making me feel uncomfortable". Or you know what? If you don't want someone to intentionally make you feel uncomfortable, just do the "I couldn't even care 1% strategy" and just keep being relaxed. If they can't make you uncomfortable, you're not gonna start stuttering or acting like a fool. In fact, I have half a mind to say "WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE SON SIT THE FREAK DOWN". Or maybe just calmly say "I do not appreciate the way you are behaving right now". Because it feels like people think just because I don't do loud outbursts that often all of a sudden they can just disrespect me all the time. Some people done forgot that I have a hot temper. And they're getting way too comfortable playing with fire.

Maybe I'm overreacting but this is just how it feels when people keep pressing me. But to follow Richard Carlson's advice, maybe the better way is just to just let it bounce off me and don't react too much. Why do I even get that angry about some pointless stuff like this though? Maybe just a really dry "Wooooooow, that's a really witty remark. You really oughta do stand-up someday." Or maybe just a series of glances around the table while making the uncomfortable smile like "oh boy do you guys see what I have to deal with" while imagining crickets chirping.

These are just unfiltered thoughts guys. Chill out.
