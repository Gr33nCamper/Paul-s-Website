I had another weird dream last night. Basically I had to escape a killer Chica animatronic with glowing eyes that was eating kids and the first level wasn't too bad because it was just hiding but the second level was WAY harder bc we had to do parkour and there were these ladders which didn't look like they extended super high until you jumped on them. As the crowd got thinner and thinner, I realized the best method would be to escape, so I made it out of the building's open window and climbed on the roof. Then somehow I got rescued and ended up in a parking lot with Ed. Apparently, he talked to some guy driving a bus/delivery vehicle and he was like "I got you guys" and we got a free ride. He was speaking either a Slavic or Middle Eastern language but he looked white and had long brown hair. The seats were super cramped though and I had trouble getting in. But then I spotted a more spacious seat where you could let your feet rest on top of the super cramped seat. Then a wahman was asking if Ed and I had plans for a road trip and I was like nah, there's not really time for that next year. But then she kept asking and I got annoyed.

This was my annual random perusal of IG and FB and I made a few profile and cover pic updates and ended up looking at pics from the past from other people's profiles. In a historical way, looking into a window of the past. Different times, different culture. Nowadays, kids don't post on each other's timelines. What do they do? Send each other TikToks? I'm like cob.

That feeling when your only time to be able to even work through your own thoughts and emotions is at work...ðŸ˜”. And over break you've been traveling so long trying to find peace and time to think. On trains, planes, cars, and all that, you've been trying to think most about what's important, but really it's more like you're trying to leave something behind.  

Reading some of my old writing assessment stories from 4th grade were pretty entertaining. In fact, we could probably do something like that rn. Just kidding, I'd need to freestyle something on the fly. Or make it based on what's happening right now. You can't rush deep reflective thoughts. It takes time, let it flow. 

Forgot I left my sunglasses in the pocket of my jacket at home. Also the bike cable lock. So I'll bike back after this and bus back for CS105, catch my breath for an hour and then go to M184 lecture and M171a discussion (those are mandatory). Think I'll do some video editing at work from now on when things get dull. So much footage to work with. And editing to experiment with.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I'm 34% in sleep debt. Alameda Sr Retreat was engaging but also I wish I had stocked up more sleep beforehand because the plenary sessions started feeling like I was getting flooded with content and I didn't have much mental energy. Plus, I wanted to sleep earlier but you know how a lot of those night time hangouts are where the interesting things are brought up. And the earliest sleep time is kind of dependent on when the group wraps up because it's not like you're gonna crawl in your sleeping bag while the lights are on and people are hanging out. Evenings are also the only time we can interact with our hosts. 

I only slept 4 and a half hrs last night and my balance is 5h 15m. I only have two nights to catch up on sleep, because Fri night is probably at most 8 hrs bc of TFN and getting up at 8a. But those HAVE to be before winter retreat because if I'm going in there with that little sleep in the bank, I'm not gonna be able to get much out of it despite having every intention to engage with the messages. Father, I only need enough energy to get to the next refuel station.

Solo trips seem a lot more appealing now. But maybe I don't want to be driving for super long alone. Unless it's in a place with lots of trees and nature. Not a windy mountain road.
