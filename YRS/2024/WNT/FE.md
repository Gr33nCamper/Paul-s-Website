The edited video for Trip's birthday was FIRE. Let's all give a round of applause for our editor Shubham Singh üëèüëèüëè. Bruh but why are all the gifs of people clapping their hands kinda mid or even questionable. Like I ain't tryna see all that.

NO MORE. IF I WANT TO BE FULLY FOCUSED, THEN NO MORE DISTRACTIONS.

The last thing I want to talk about are the themes that color or colored my life, by which I mean both styles and historical periods. Now of course, there's gonna be some you might expect, like the 1940s WWII period just because this was where we saw both the worst and best of humanity since it was a fight against evil and totalitarianism. Also during this time, it seemed like people were much more well-dressed and focused on what they needed to do. And have you ever seen lectures from that time? There were really great minds. The hats, coats, suits, ties, and black and white picture films are kind of memorialized in our culture.

The other ones are cottagecore, the whole of the 19th century, and colonial times/Disney. Like the English countryside with rolling green hills and farms, but also there are gardens. And the fog has a kind of mysterious or magical effect. Colonial times/Disney make me think of villages with town squares and clock towers and cold winter nights and cemeteries and dead trees. But also gaslamps and heavy coats and walking sticks and scarves. Schoolmasters writing on chalkboards, the wooden classroom, arithmetic sums, and apples. Old toymakers with spectacles and people with specialized trades like bakers, carpenters, bookkeepeers, etc. And I've mentioned why I like the 19th century so much in previous entries, but to elaborate more: there's not only the wild west with cowboys and Native Americans but also - actually that's a really big part of it. The idea of pioneering and exploring uncharted wilderness appeals to something deep within me. To gaze upon sights that no one has ever seen before. Everything was more classical, with compasses and the stars, logs that people would write in, wagons, horses. But also there's print so books and newspapers exist and the style of the writing and pictures appeals to me a lot. I mean, have you seen the political cartoons around the 1860 presidential election? They're actually quite illuminating and the drawing style is kind of scratchy, but that's exactly the kind of style I like. And woodcuts. If you ask me, those styles have just enough roughness to not look too clean and complete, but without sacrificing detail. This kind of older style is quite comforting to me, it makes me think about curling up by the fireplace and studying the images as if I received them from a wise older gentleman who has seen more of the world than me and who wishes to share his findings.
