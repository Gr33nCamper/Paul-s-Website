The edited video for Trip's birthday was FIRE. Let's all give a round of applause for our editor Shubham Singh üëèüëèüëè. Bruh but why are all the gifs of people clapping their hands kinda mid or even questionable. Like I ain't tryna see all that.

NO MORE. IF I WANT TO BE FULLY FOCUSED, THEN NO MORE DISTRACTIONS.

The last thing I want to talk about are the themes that color or colored my life, by which I mean both styles and historical periods. Now of course, there's gonna be some you might expect, like the 1940s WWII period just because this was where we saw both the worst and best of humanity since it was a fight against evil and totalitarianism. Also during this time, it seemed like people were much more well-dressed and focused on what they needed to do. And have you ever seen lectures from that time? There were really great minds. The hats, coats, suits, ties, and black and white picture films are kind of memorialized in our culture.

The other ones are cottagecore, the whole of the 19th century, and colonial times/Disney. Like the English countryside with rolling green hills and farms, but also there are gardens. And the fog has a kind of mysterious or magical effect. Colonial times/Disney make me think of villages with town squares and clock towers and cold winter nights and cemeteries and dead trees. But also gaslamps and heavy coats and walking sticks and scarves. Schoolmasters writing on chalkboards, the wooden classroom, arithmetic sums, and apples. Old toymakers with spectacles and people with specialized trades like bakers, carpenters, bookkeepeers, etc. And I've mentioned why I like the 19th century so much in previous entries, but to elaborate more: there's not only the wild west with cowboys and Native Americans but also - actually that's a really big part of it. The idea of pioneering and exploring uncharted wilderness appeals to something deep within me. To gaze upon sights that no one has ever seen before. Everything was more classical, with compasses and the stars, logs that people would write in, wagons, horses. But also there's print so books and newspapers exist and the style of the writing and pictures appeals to me a lot. I mean, have you seen the political cartoons around the 1860 presidential election? They're actually quite illuminating and the drawing style is kind of scratchy, but that's exactly the kind of style I like. And woodcuts. If you ask me, those styles have just enough roughness to not look too clean and complete, but without sacrificing detail. This kind of older style is quite comforting to me, it makes me think about curling up by the fireplace and studying the images as if I received them from a wise older gentleman who has seen more of the world than me and wishes to share his findings.

Week has flown by even though so much has happened. I guess my perceived speed of passage of time is independent of how much happens that day. Well, if not that much happens, then it's a little boring and in that sense, I guess time would feel like it's crawling by.
I'll just remark though that when I was a kid, time felt super slow. Maybe it was because I needed more to be entertained or occupied. Now there are just thoughts that occupy my mind.

Was gassy the whole night and this morning, I felt the mild, medium, and hot salsas from yesterday's Chipotle. I was originally supposed to leave around 6:20 to catch the 201 and get to the trolley. But bc of having to empty the tank, I was slightly behind schedule. So I decided to take a gamble and bike since it didn't look like it was gonna rain. But literally within a minute of exiting LR, the sprinkling picked up and I got rained on. However, it's not so bad. I decided to power through the rain instead of taking a detour to the UTC Trolley station. The rain let up later on thankfully. It was actually kind of refreshing to tell you the truth. It seems counterintuitive but only when I'm dying (to my fleshly desires) does it feel like I'm truly alive. For only something that is alive can die. The dead cannot. It's like how St. Augustine writes in his Confessions that something which is corruptible must have some good in it initially, because something that is already 100% bad cannot be corrupted further to make the point that evil is the absence of goodness.

Sebastian actually a real one for giving all those rides in the rain. I think he was quite entertained by PvZ yesterday.

Now it's time to get going on Chem 168 and M184 Hw.

I keep failing when I try to fight the German army inside me. But I must pick myself up again, repent, and try again.

Might need a decaf coffee at this rate. So much on my plate rn.

Did not feel like waking up today for DT, but pushed through since what is my faith made of if not these small moments. Got McBreakfast afterwards. Turns out they stopped selling the toasted bagels. I'm like cob.

THE M184 MIDTERM WAS TOO EASY.

Presentation night and grilled burgers exceeded my expectations. Now I wish I had sent in a presentation, but since it's no longer WI23, I'm no longer as obsessed with quantum mechanics, but I would probably put something historical or about geography like the forested regions of the US that Sebastian and I traveled to.

Ever wish you had a small house in a small town suburb with a desktop computer where you could just go for a few days or a weekend and just get a bunch of work done while looking at awesome scenery like trees and have access to basic conveniences but without the hustle and bustle? And being able to be more isolated to really focus? Even better if it's raining most of those days. But you'd be inside so it wouldn't really matter that much.

Ping Pong with Sujal was a success! üèì LGGGGGGG

Getting suspended on Valentine's Day. Wouldn't want it any other way üôÉ. When you incorrectly assume being slightly late to an early morning shift is gonna be acceptable. I'm like ok my bad.

Jk, I think it's just attendance points. I mean, if we really want to avoid anything like this from happening in the future, we just need to get up around 5:50 everyday, not just W and Th so then it's just a habit. At a certain point, some things just aren't worth it.

And also what am I supposed to say? I had ear pain so I couldn't sleep properly? But I know that's not the real reason. The only two true reasons would be I didn't finish my CS105 HW ahead of time which meant I stayed up later and I tried out the ear pick. The other reason is that I got up around 4:30 briefly but went back to bed since I was still tired. Should have went to bed earlier or jumped up at the 4:30a time. Basically there's nothing I can argue in terms of justice. Whatever I say doesn't change the fact I was late. And even though I didn't miss any pickups, they're still punishing me so I can't even cite that as a reason.

I suppose I can appeal to humanity or forgiveness. But that's probably not gonna work. If I say something like suppose you were in my shoes with four classes and idk should I bring up stuff like how the Bay Area storms hit my family hard and our fence got knocked down and how not too long ago Mom had to get surgery for her arm? It's not just like I decided to be late one day. But I guess they expect you to exercise more forethought. Whatever. Thankfully you don't have to enjoy punishments to uphold justice. I can dislike being suspended and yet still agree to getting suspended right? Or do I have to enjoy being punished? Isn't that just masochism?

Enough of that. I'm just listening to calming underwater piano pieces. Read some of my old college app and HUM essays last night. I was impressed.

Longest, most unexpected Presidents' Day Weekend so far. Unexpected local gems discovered in Carmel Mtn. and Scripps Ranch, Sawires Supper. Kinda just feel like watching CoryxKenshin or playing PvZ2 but we all know those have a tendency to go overboard very easily. I mean, heck, on Thu night I was at Geisel for like an hr playing Frostbite Caves. The mammoth boss was actually tough.

Off to bed now, I'll write more tmr.
