The edited video for Trip's birthday was FIRE. Let's all give a round of applause for our editor Shubham Singh üëèüëèüëè. Bruh but why are all the gifs of people clapping their hands kinda mid or even questionable. Like I ain't tryna see all that.

NO MORE. IF I WANT TO BE FULLY FOCUSED, THEN NO MORE DISTRACTIONS.

The last thing I want to talk about are the themes that color or have colored my life, by which I mean both styles and historical periods. Now of course, there's gonna be some you might expect, like the 1940s WWII period just because this was where we saw both the worst and best of humanity since it was a fight against evil and totalitarianism. Also during this time, it seemed like people were much more well-dressed and focused on what they needed to do. And have you ever seen lectures from that time? There were really great minds. The hats, coats, suits, ties, and black and white picture films are kind of memorialized in our culture.

The other ones are cottagecore, the whole of the 19th century, and colonial times/Disney. Like the English countryside with rolling green hills and farms, but also there are gardens. And the fog has a kind of mysterious or magical effect. Colonial times/Disney make me think of villages with town squares and clock towers and cold winter nights and cemeteries and dead trees. But also gaslamps and heavy coats and walking sticks and scarves. Schoolmasters writing on chalkboards, the wooden classroom, arithmetic sums, and apples. Old toymakers with spectacles and people with specialized trades like bakers, carpenters, bookkeepeers, etc. And I've mentioned why I like the 19th century so much in previous entries, but to elaborate more: there's not only the wild west with cowboys and Native Americans but also - actually that's a really big part of it. The idea of pioneering and exploring uncharted wilderness appeals to something deep within me. To gaze upon sights that no one has ever seen before. Everything was more classical, with compasses and the stars, logs that people would write in, wagons, horses. But also there's print so books and newspapers exist and the style of the writing and pictures appeals to me a lot. I mean, have you seen the political cartoons around the 1860 presidential election? They're actually quite illuminating and the drawing style is kind of scratchy, but that's exactly the kind of style I like. And woodcuts. If you ask me, those styles have just enough roughness to not look too clean and complete, but without sacrificing detail. This kind of older style is quite comforting to me, it makes me think about curling up by the fireplace and studying the images as if I received them from a wise, old gentleman who has seen more of the world than me and wishes to share what he's learned.

Week has flown by even though so much has happened. I guess my perceived speed of passage of time is independent of how much happens that day. Well, if not that much happens, then it's a little boring and in that sense, I guess time would feel like it's crawling by.
I'll just remark though that when I was a kid, time felt super slow. Maybe it was because I needed more to be entertained or occupied. Now there are just thoughts that occupy my mind.

Was gassy the whole night and this morning, I felt the mild, medium, and hot salsas from yesterday's Chipotle. I was originally supposed to leave around 6:20 to catch the 201 and get to the trolley. But bc of having to empty the tank, I was slightly behind schedule. So I decided to take a gamble and bike since it didn't look like it was gonna rain. But literally within a minute of exiting LR, the sprinkling picked up and I got rained on. However, it's not so bad. I decided to power through the rain instead of taking a detour to the UTC Trolley station. The rain let up later on thankfully. It was actually kind of refreshing to tell you the truth. It seems counterintuitive but only when I'm dying (to my fleshly desires) does it feel like I'm truly alive. For only something that is alive can die. The dead cannot. It's like how St. Augustine writes in his Confessions that something which is corruptible must have some good in it initially, because something that is already 100% bad cannot be corrupted further to make the point that evil is the absence of goodness.

Sebastian actually a real one for giving all those rides in the rain. I think he was quite entertained by PvZ yesterday.

Now it's time to get going on Chem 168 and M184 Hw.

I keep failing when I try to fight the German army inside me. But I must pick myself up again, repent, and try again.

Might need a decaf coffee at this rate. So much on my plate rn.

Did not feel like waking up today for DT, but pushed through since what is my faith made of if not these small moments. Got McBreakfast afterwards. Turns out they stopped selling the toasted bagels. I'm like cob.

THE M184 MIDTERM WAS TOO EASY.

Presentation night and grilled burgers exceeded my expectations. Now I wish I had sent in a presentation, but since it's no longer WI23, I'm no longer as obsessed with quantum mechanics, but I would probably put something historical or about geography like the forested regions of the US that Sebastian and I traveled to.

Ever wish you had a small house in a small town suburb with a desktop computer where you could just go for a few days or a weekend and just get a bunch of work done while looking at awesome scenery like trees and have access to basic conveniences but without the hustle and bustle? And being able to be more isolated to really focus? Even better if it's raining most of those days. But you'd be inside so it wouldn't really matter that much.

Ping Pong with Sujal was a success! üèì LGGGGGGG

Getting suspended on Valentine's Day. Wouldn't want it any other way üôÉ. When you incorrectly assume being slightly late to an early morning shift is gonna be acceptable. I'm like ok my bad.

Jk, I think it's just attendance points. I mean, if we really want to avoid anything like this from happening in the future, we just need to get up around 5:50 everyday, not just W and Th so then it's just a habit. At a certain point, some things just aren't worth it.

And also what am I supposed to say? I had ear pain so I couldn't sleep properly? But I know that's not the real reason. The only two true reasons would be I didn't finish my CS105 HW ahead of time which meant I stayed up later and I tried out the ear pick. The other reason is that I got up around 4:30 briefly but went back to bed since I was still tired. Should have went to bed earlier or jumped up at the 4:30a time. Basically there's nothing I can argue in terms of justice. Whatever I say doesn't change the fact I was late. And even though I didn't miss any pickups, they're still punishing me so I can't even cite that as a reason.

I suppose I can appeal to humanity or forgiveness. But that's probably not gonna work. If I say something like suppose you were in my shoes with four classes and idk should I bring up stuff like how the Bay Area storms hit my family hard and our fence got knocked down and how not too long ago Mom had to get surgery for her arm? It's not just like I decided to be late one day. But I guess they expect you to exercise more forethought. Whatever. Thankfully you don't have to enjoy punishments to uphold justice. I can dislike being suspended and yet still agree to getting suspended right? Or do I have to enjoy being punished? Isn't that just masochism?

Enough of that. I'm just listening to calming underwater piano pieces. Read some of my old college app and HUM essays last night. I was impressed.

Longest, most unexpected Presidents' Day Weekend so far. Unexpected local gems discovered in Carmel Mtn and Scripps Ranch, Sawires Supper. Kinda just feel like watching CoryxKenshin or playing PvZ2 but we all know those have a tendency to go overboard very easily. I mean, heck, on Thu night I was at Geisel for like an hr playing Frostbite Caves. The mammoth boss was actually tough.

Off to bed now, I'll write more tmr.

The bus fr left early today. Fortunately, it doesn't actually take 6 min to walk to the station when you know the shortcut to take.

Mack's earplugs work great. I slept super quickly, but this is the second night in a row one earplug fell out. Also might have to clean ears again later today. Especially the left ear. Looked up how to properly insert earplugs and apparently the twist method might work better. Also prior handwashing was recommended.

Found out there's this Sichuanese TV show from 2001 called ÊñπËÑëÂ£≥ÁöÑÊïÖ‰∫ã ("The Story of Fang Nao Ke") and it's quite entertaining but doesn't have anything seriously questionable in it as far as I can tell.

Guess who got chewed out at work today? Turns out I should have taken a right and gone the local route through the health campus to central trolley station instead of making a left since that leads to an intersection where only right turns are allowed. In upholding the traffic laws, I ended up making a much larger loop and when I saw the giant sloping road with the hill and freeway entrances, I felt a fear I was gripped by a fear I hadn't felt in a long time and my heart rate went way up. It's kind of like when you're on a roller coaster except unlike a ride, this one doesn't end after a minute or two. There was also only ~ a quarter tank left in the Honda Civic.

Mock interview was unexpectedly illuminating. In a good way.

Knocking out the Project for CS105 and then starting M184 HW6. Then I should get started on M171A HW5 and studying since the final midterm is next Thurs and I did super trash on the first one bc I didn't know how to solve ELPs at the time. And on that note, I should probably get going on HW4 for CS105 since my group wants to rendezvous on Sat night I'm like relax bruh U think I have infinite time??

Why do I feel 100x more alive recording a video for CS105Project at like 3 in the morning? I mean, it's actually kind of a peaceful, yet somehow exhilarating vibe??

Time to knock out the M184 HW and head to bed.

Don't you just detest when your freedom to be left alone gets repeatedly infringed upon at work? Me too.

"WhY wErE U lAtE 4 WoRk? iSn'T dRiViNg CaRtS uR LiFe PuRpOsE??" and I'm like do me a favor and just stop talking as if you know me like that. There's other stuff going on in my life. I have other thoughts occupying my head like my own inner nature, finding peace and meaning, connecting with God, but also stuff like ping pong and sichuanese.

Don't you see that it's kind of difficult to make it to work on time when it's so early in the morning? I mean, at least by only public transportation or biking? But no, you choose to look only at my failures. Never did I hear a thank you for picking people up on time or not being late at all last week. But the second I make an honest mistake like a wrong turn on a shuttle loop or forgetting that I can't legally make a left turn and that also there aren't U-turns until a bunch of other intersections later, everybody is on me. I hate having to deal with some dumb incident every other week and explaining why I'm not trying to sabotage the entire Triton Transit Operation. Why do you immediately assume I have ill intentions against the company? It's like they expect me to be perfect. Whoever said that work gives your life meaning would be right. If they were referring to a company with a good work culture. Not this idiocy where I can't even be left alone for two weeks. I know my credit isn't that great right now, but could you cut me some slack? The sooner you loosen your grip around my neck, the sooner I can actually do my job. I mean, how would you like it if someone constantly breathed down your neck? Would you feel comfortable?

Should I open with a "Good morning Jacqueline! How are you today? Ah wonderful! Here's to an incident-free day! Because incidents just love to tail me" ? Or "Good morning! My, do I love working here! There's nothing I'd rather be doing rn! üòÉ" -said no one ever.

Personally, I don't really mind honest incidents. Between you and I, they often make things more interesting. It's just that certain people get super peeved when they arise and want to make sure I get chewed out. But I guess "work operation" and "efficiency" take higher precedence than keeping things from getting boring. Alas, I guess variety and nonuniformity are not welcome there. I guess you think a boring life is a small cost for high efficiency. For me, that is a price I simply refuse to pay. That's my biggest problem with a fixed schedule.

I guess I just figured I needed to do less to be left alone, not more. It's cool, I'm not gonna let them ruin my whole day. You guys think I care even 1% that you don't like me? As if your approval is what I was seeking. Yet, the Lord knows I wasn't trying to cut corners this time around. So even if they punish me for not doing anything wrong, I know my Heavenly Father sees that it is unjust suffering. Because in what world is it wrong to obey the traffic laws? And next time I'll keep the radio on Channel 3 and take a right instead of a left when I exit the station lot. It's not that serious.

That feeling as if no one gets or trusts you. And when nobody can vouch for you. That's the killer. When it feels as if you're the only one who understands your side of the story and the other person simply assumes you're the bad guy and there's nothing you can do about it. Like ok, you didn't really give me a chance to explain, but sure I guess I'm wrong again. You win. (This is definitely a fair case, right guys? Not like I needed a fighting chance or anything)

But anyways, I don't really feel like talking about that anymore. I'd rather beat some zombies or play ping pong. Or watch Adam Bobrow or Pongfinity or The Story of Fang Nao Ke.

This week has been an unexpected one so far and it's only the third day of the work week. Especially yesterday. To name a few things, I went to SunGod Lawn for personal DT (Geisel fire alarm went off) and was super deep in thought about the "crown of righteousness" which God will award all those who "love his appearing" and then Kristian happened to be outside around the same area. Oh! Also I got the $15 Curry UpNow lunch combo deal and it was FIRE. Afterwards, watched a little bit of Fang Nao Ke's story and it was quite amusing. Since I don't know all the Sichuanese or Mandarin terms for things, I had to kind of use context clues to figure out what was going on, but that made it more interesting to be honest, since it's not like you're just brainlessly consuming content. Biked back home around 10p and it was super peaceful since barely anyone was on the road. Got an inner tube leak in the last few yards on the way back home, which was kind of a bummer. Bryan helped me patch it up. This marks both the first inner tube repair of Gideon's bike and my first repair of 2024. The patch kit Dad bought in 2019 is still pulling weight I'm like LET'S GOOOOOO. Now, I gotta get the front brake checked out probably tmr. 

Yeah the Geisel Table 15 min study session wasn't awkward at all.

First time going to lectures and discussion in like 3 wks. Worth it. Chewed a lot of gum but still dozed off in M184. 

Almost weeping tears at the bus stop bc the Courage the Cowardly Dog Accordion Theme Arrangement is so beautiful and evokes a distant memory of senior year of high school. S/o to C AwH.

Felt like I was going to pass out. That's what happens when you're super in sleep debt and are carrying so many items at once. Doesn't help that the library is so packed like everybody trying to be here or what? Save some seats for the rest of us.

Please help me Father. I'm dying.
