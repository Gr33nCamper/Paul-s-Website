Happy Birthday to Mr. Ekwall! ðŸŽ‚

-

Way too full after Subway. It was only a footlong and a cookie 

This time I didn't go crazy with RPG horror and CoryXKenshin

I speak very little during M183 discussion (I don't talk)

-

Please don't text me just for fun 

I take no pleasure in simply texting, there's literally no point

Unless it's an emergency or about something that's going to happen irl soon like picking up, hanging out

Calls are fine, preferably keep it short 

Two long calls is the max for one day

Usually I only call Ed

-

Quiet hours alone are very valuable to me 

It's not the same when it's with other people you know but quiet

Like prayer mtg

However, I do enjoy watching a movie alone in theatres every now and then

I've got to do that again sometime

Haven't done that since _Avatar_ re-release last Sep

-

In summer, it's less people you run into 

But the people you run into are more likely to be people you know

I only have so much energy for talking

Pls leave me alone 

I don't hate you, just don't feel like talking rn

-

Ah, it's so quiet up here on the 7th floor 

Wish I could stay here longer 

Or maybe that's just how I feel right now 

Maybe in like three hours I'd be like "GET ME OUTTA HERE I'M LOSING MY MIND FROM DOING CALCULATING CONFIDENCE INTERVALS AND P-VALUES"

Haha 

No, but it's true though. I don't even think I could watch CoryXKenshin or listen to music for more than 2 hours on end. It will eventually get boring. Even if it's something I like

Flammable Maths (aka Papa Flammy) has reached his GoFundMe goal! LET'S GOO 

I saw his video yesterday about how he was dealing with pain in his abdomen that felt like getting stabbed with hot knives/needles and then how his laptop broke down completely so he has to film with his phone and an SD card. Also how he depends on YouTube for making a living and must support his wife and daughter. I donated 20 Euros because I felt like he could use it more than me and that's basically how much I spend on Vons groceries anyways. Pity motivated me to respond in this way, instead of only feeling bad but not doing anything 

(*Application of the Sunday Message on the Good Samaritan and how feelings are good, but if you don't act on the pity and compassion you feel to help someone out, then it's just cheap feelings)
