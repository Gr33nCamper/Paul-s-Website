Happy Birthday to Mr. Ekwall! üéÇ

-

Way too full after Subway. It was only a footlong and a cookie 

This time I didn't go crazy with RPG horror and CoryXKenshin

I speak very little during M183 discussion (I don't talk)

-

Please don't text me just for fun 

I take no pleasure in simply texting, there's literally no point

Unless it's an emergency or about something that's going to happen irl soon like picking up, hanging out

Calls are fine, preferably keep it short 

Two long calls is the max for one day

Usually I only call Ed

-

Quiet hours alone are very valuable to me 

It's not the same when it's with other people you know but quiet

Like prayer mtg

However, I do enjoy watching a movie alone in theatres every now and then

I've got to do that again sometime

Haven't done that since _Avatar_ re-release last Sep

-

In summer, it's less people you run into 

But the people you run into are more likely to be people you know

I only have so much energy for talking

Pls leave me alone 

I don't hate you, just don't feel like talking rn

-

Ah, it's so quiet up here on the 7th floor 

Wish I could stay here longer 

Or maybe that's just how I feel right now 

Maybe in like three hours I'd be like "GET ME OUTTA HERE I'M LOSING MY MIND FROM DOING CALCULATING CONFIDENCE INTERVALS AND P-VALUES"

Haha 

No, but it's true though. I don't even think I could watch CoryXKenshin or listen to music for more than 2 hours on end. It will eventually get boring. Even if it's something I like

Flammable Maths (aka Papa Flammy) has reached his GoFundMe goal! LET'S GOO 

I saw his video yesterday about how he was dealing with pain in his abdomen that felt like getting stabbed with hot knives/needles and then how his laptop broke down completely so he has to film with his phone and an SD card. Also how he depends on YouTube for making a living and must support his wife and daughter. I donated 20 Euros because I felt like he could use it more than me and that's basically how much I spend on Vons groceries anyways. Pity motivated me to respond in this way, instead of only feeling bad but not doing anything 

(*Application of the Sunday Message on the Good Samaritan and how feelings are good, but if you don't act on the pity and compassion you feel to help someone out, then it's just cheap feelings)

I've gone 

for too long 

living like I'm not alive

**Aug 10, 2023:** 

Wow, SS1 ended a lot changed in one week

-

Back again confiding in a website that nobody reads

To be honest, it's not so bad

Journals aren't meant to be read by others 

You know what I really hate? 

Having to explain things which appear very obvious to me 

Like I didn't know I had to rigorously prove why I'm a certain way

I like to give minimal explanation and allow the listener to connect the dots 

But I guess it's too much to assume that most people have common sense

-

It's not that serious 

My text was short for clarity of communication

Not because I didn't want you to come over 

I wanted you to save your time

I'm sorry you thought I was being blunt

Dearest roommate üòä

-

I get that criticism is natural and to be expected

But that doesn't make it any easier to swallow

-

This week may have been the most consistent for sleeping and waking 

Realized how little time I actually have each day due to lectures and DT and eating and stuff

First CSE101 lecture it felt like I was in an alternate TFN bc that's the only time I would be in a lecture hall that late

-

Thinking about learning Latin

In written form, it looks quite elegant

But hearing it spoken, I was like this kinda just sounds like older Italian?

-

yES, yes bc apparently you know all about dating and women we all care SO much

I'm definitely the weirdo for trying to live my life in a way that is countercultural 

When the message of the gospel is not of this world

So why would we ever expect the world to embrace the message? 

And why would I ever expect you to understand the purpose of my life

-

Since it's my journal, I don't have to make it sensical right? 

Ok then, let's invite Paula Wu! 

... 

Omygosh Hiiii guys, welcome back to my life üòù

I've missed you all soooo much üíã

Well, what should I tell you about? 

It looks like Paul has some hw to get through and lectures to catch up on before his bus leaves 

Quite the busy man right? Well, that's what you might think

But if you REALLY knew him like me, you'd know that deep down he's just a little boy ü•∫

Who likes stuff like superheroes, sports, and adventure

Even though he likes to talk about science and math and programming

And enjoys stuff like literature, philosophy, and history on the side, specifically American

Oh, and you'll often see him giving that smirk and trying to make funny comments

But that's really a defense mechanism to avoid talking about uncomfortable stuff

Question in the crowd? 

Unnamed guy: Yes, what is your relationship to Paul? 

Paula: Oh you know, we just go really far back haha. Some might call us "brother and sister" because we've known each other for practically our whole lives. I mean, I grew up with two younger sisters Jacqueline and Michaela and there was always pressure to do well in school and set an example for them. Also being on the volleyball team showed me how to work well with others. He's a lot more studious than me though. Like, he would spend whole weekends just doing calculus problems. Like fam, I was knocked out during the breaks and bingewatching so many KDramas üò≠. To save my family money, I decided to go to CC, but I'm still jealous that he got to be in San Diego for three years. He has two younger brothers Jack and Michael. Yeah, crazy right? It's almost like we're the exact counterparts to each other. He was talking to his former coworker Ann in the fall quarter of his first year on campus, but he kept trying to be "mysterious" and stuff like his favorite artist at the time and didn't really keep in touch too much. Also he thought it would be too annoying or cliche to just text about normal stuff. That led to him getting ghosted and it kind of did a number on him. Like, he called me about it and I was like I'm so sorry to hear that, do you want to talk about it? We ended up going to the park to watch the ducks and get some fresh air. He was just crying on my shoulder for like an hour and I was like "There there, it's alright". (Support your male friends gals! They need a hug sometimes too!) Poor guy :( He told me he was really thankful to have me around considering it was the summer and all. He wasn't that close to his friends from high school and he had a bad experience with trying to organize a hangout last summer. So he spent a lot of time walking outside alone. He's told me that his hometown is so connected to the past that he can't think about the future from there. Like his old elementary school, jr high school, high schools, and all the familiar sights are all around him. Being there, he feels stuck in a shadow of his past if he's there too long. But if it's only a little bit, then it's good for reflecting on where he came from. And in San Diego, it's not like people are gonna bring up stuff from the past so he was able to forge his new identity in Christ there and meet a lot of cool people.

That summer, there were so many times we would have late night calls or go walking around the lake talking about life. He had a lot to say. It sounded like he was going through some stuff. He was questioning his purpose in life and wondering why the old things he used to like like running outside, watching YouTube and anime, movies, and music weren't as enjoyable anymore. In fact, he started thinking that his life had to have more purpose than simply showering and eating and trying to stave off boredom. He told me it was a struggle to keep living. The isolation was starting to crush him. He'd message anyone he could and try to say a lot of things, but I don't think they really wanted to hear what he was saying. To be honest, it was a little difficult to sit through his talks also, but being his "sister" and all, I couldn't really turn him down. 

In September, he told me he had something to show me and I was like oh ok, what is it? He invited me over to his place. His mom was like "Oh, welcome back Paula! It's always good to see you!" I gave her a hug. She's really sweet. Paul is lucky to have such a loving mom. He enters his room and puts on this red wig. I'm like Okkk first of all, you didn't have to copy my style like that but gurl now I gotta get you looking absolutely gorgeous! So I ended up styling the wig into a bun and let him wear my spare sailor moon shirt. I also did his makeup and nails and let me tell you, he was REALLY rocking the look like yasss queennn üòç. It's not often you have dudes who are down for stuff like this. Between you and me, he looked really cute and I'm like, dang you definitely get your looks from your mom

... *unimpressed looks from audience*

Oh come on guys! 

*Audience booes* üçÖ

It was merely my attempt at writing from a different perspective!
