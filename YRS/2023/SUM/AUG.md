Happy Birthday to Mr. Ekwall! üéÇ

-

Way too full after Subway. It was only a footlong and a cookie 

This time I didn't go crazy with RPG horror and CoryXKenshin

I speak very little during M183 discussion (I don't talk)

-

Please don't text me just for fun 

I take no pleasure in simply texting, there's literally no point

Unless it's an emergency or about something that's going to happen irl soon like picking up, hanging out

Calls are fine, preferably keep it short 

Two long calls is the max for one day

Usually I only call Ed

-

Quiet hours alone are very valuable to me 

It's not the same when it's with other people you know but quiet

Like prayer mtg

However, I do enjoy watching a movie alone in theatres every now and then

I've got to do that again sometime

Haven't done that since _Avatar_ re-release last Sep

-

In summer, it's less people you run into 

But the people you run into are more likely to be people you know

I only have so much energy for talking

Pls leave me alone 

I don't hate you, just don't feel like talking rn

-

Ah, it's so quiet up here on the 7th floor 

Wish I could stay here longer 

Or maybe that's just how I feel right now 

Maybe in like three hours I'd be like "GET ME OUTTA HERE I'M LOSING MY MIND FROM DOING CALCULATING CONFIDENCE INTERVALS AND P-VALUES"

Haha 

No, but it's true though. I don't even think I could watch CoryXKenshin or listen to music for more than 2 hours on end. It will eventually get boring. Even if it's something I like

-

Flammable Maths (aka Papa Flammy) has reached his GoFundMe goal! LET'S GOO 

I saw his video yesterday about how he was dealing with pain in his abdomen that felt like getting stabbed with hot knives/needles and then how his laptop broke down completely so he has to film with his phone and an SD card. Also how he depends on YouTube for making a living and must support his wife and daughter. I donated 20 Euros because I felt like he could use it more than me and that's basically how much I spend on Vons groceries anyways. Pity motivated me to respond in this way, instead of only feeling bad but not doing anything 

(*Application of the Sunday Message on the Good Samaritan and how feelings are good, but if you don't act on the pity and compassion you feel to help someone out, then it's just cheap feelings)

I've gone

**Aug 10, 2023:** 

Wow, SS1 ended a lot changed in one week

-

Back again confiding in a website that nobody reads

To be honest, it's not so bad

Journals aren't meant to be read by others 

You know what I really hate? 

Having to explain things which appear very obvious to me 

Like I didn't know I had to rigorously prove why I'm a certain way

I like to give minimal explanation and allow the listener to connect the dots 

But I guess it's too much to assume that most people have common sense

-

It's not that serious 

My text was short for clarity of communication

Not because I didn't want you to come over 

I wanted you to save your time

I'm sorry you thought I was being blunt

Dearest roommate üòä

-

I get that criticism is natural and to be expected

But that doesn't make it any easier to swallow

-

This week may have been the most consistent for sleeping and waking 

Realized how little time I actually have each day due to lectures and DT and eating and stuff

First CSE101 lecture it felt like I was in an alternate TFN bc that's the only time I would be in a lecture hall that late

-

Thinking about learning Latin

In written form, it looks quite elegant

But hearing it spoken, I was like this kinda just sounds like older Italian?

-

yES, yes bc apparently you know all about dating and women we all care SO much

I'm definitely the weirdo for trying to live my life in a way that is countercultural 

When the message of the gospel is not of this world

So why would we ever expect the world to embrace the message? 

And why would I ever expect you to understand the purpose of my life

-

Since it's my journal, I don't have to make it sensical right? 

Ok then, let's invite Paula Wu! 

... 

Omygosh Hiiii guys, welcome back to my life üòù

I've missed you all soooo much üíã

Well, what should I tell you about? 

It looks like Paul has some hw to get through and lectures to catch up on before his bus leaves 

Quite the busy man right? Well, that's what you might think

But if you REALLY knew him like me, you'd know that deep down he's just a little boy ü•∫

Who likes stuff like superheroes, sports, and adventure

Even though he likes to talk about science and math and programming

And enjoys stuff like literature, philosophy, and history on the side, specifically American

Oh, and you'll often see him giving that smirk and trying to make funny comments

But that's really a defense mechanism to avoid talking about uncomfortable stuff

Question in the crowd? 

Unnamed guy: Yes, what is your relationship to Paul? 

Paula: Oh you know, we just go really far back haha. Some might call us "brother and sister" because we've known each other for practically our whole lives. I mean, I grew up with two younger sisters Jacqueline and Michaela and there was always pressure to do well in school and set an example for them. Also being on the volleyball team showed me how to work well with others. He's a lot more studious than me though. Like, he would spend whole weekends just doing calculus problems. Like fam, I was knocked out during the breaks and bingewatching so many KDramas üò≠. To save my family money, I decided to go to CC, but I'm still jealous that he got to be in San Diego for three years. He has two younger brothers Jack and Michael. Yeah, crazy right? It's almost like we're the exact counterparts to each other. He was talking to his former coworker Ann in the fall quarter of his first year on campus, but he kept trying to be "mysterious" and stuff like his favorite artist at the time and didn't really keep in touch too much. Also he thought it would be too annoying or cliche to just text about normal stuff. That led to him getting ghosted and it kind of did a number on him. Like, he called me about it and I was like I'm so sorry to hear that, do you want to talk about it? We ended up going to the park to watch the ducks and get some fresh air. He was just crying on my shoulder for like an hour and I was like "There there, it's alright". (Support your male friends gals! They need a hug sometimes too!) Poor guy :( He told me he was really thankful to have me around considering it was the summer and all. He wasn't that close to his friends from high school and he had a bad experience with trying to organize a hangout last summer. So he spent a lot of time walking outside alone. He's told me that his hometown is so connected to the past that he can't think about the future from there. Like his old elementary school, jr high school, high schools, and all the familiar sights are all around him. Being there, he feels stuck in a shadow of his past if he's there too long. But if it's only a little bit, then it's good for reflecting on where he came from. And in San Diego, it's not like people are gonna bring up stuff from the past so he was able to forge his new identity in Christ there and meet a lot of cool people.

That summer, there were so many times we would have late night calls or go walking around the lake talking about life. He had a lot to say. It sounded like he was going through some stuff. He was questioning his purpose in life and wondering why the old things he used to like like running outside, watching YouTube and anime, movies, and music weren't as enjoyable anymore. In fact, he started thinking that his life had to have more purpose than simply showering and eating and trying to stave off boredom. He told me it was a struggle to keep living. The isolation was starting to crush him. He'd message anyone he could and try to say a lot of things, but I don't think they really wanted to hear what he was saying. To be honest, it was a little difficult to sit through his talks also, but being his "sister" and all, I couldn't really turn him down. 

In September, he told me he had something to show me and I was like oh ok, what is it? He invited me over to his place. His mom was like "Oh, welcome back Paula! It's always good to see you!" I gave her a hug. She's really sweet. Paul is lucky to have such a loving mom. He enters his room and puts on this red wig. I'm like Okkk first of all, you didn't have to copy my style like that but gurl now I gotta get you looking absolutely gorgeous! So I ended up styling the wig into a bun and let him wear my spare sailor moon shirt. I also did his makeup and nails and let me tell you, he was REALLY rocking the look like yasss queennn üòç. It's not often you have dudes who are down for stuff like this. Between you and me, he looked really cute and I'm like, dang you definitely get your looks from your mom

Oh come on guys!

SLT return lunch 

Success!

-

Ran for the first time in a long time 

Feeling too stressed, so I wanted to burn it all away 

It helped and also the punk music was energizing

Although tbh, the stuff I listen to is getting kinda old

And I don't even listen to music that much anymore 

It's cool, but not EVERYTHING

Sometimes I just want to hear the birds chirping and wind blowing

-

I should really consider running more frequently, not just when I'm about to drown in stress

Also opening up about what I'm going through with God in prayer 

I know we're the church family and all, but sometimes I'm just not in the mood to deal with super heavy stuff 

Like yeah yeah we get it you're going through stuff, he's going through stuff, who isn't going through stuff? 

I guess that's coming from the perspective that somehow all our problems can cease on Earth for a short time

If only that were true 

-

Why someone needs to return home four times in one summer is beyond me

like wOW it's been SOOOO long mom and dad 

I definitely didn't see you guys like two weeks ago

Everything looks exactly the same!!!!! üòÉüëç

And it's not like I haven't lived here...idk, MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD

-

Maybe it's because I personally don't think going home really changes things

And I view the thoughts of someone who hasn't traveled as being more subject to skepticism 

Since it's obviously going to be saturated in and painted by their life experience in one location

If you ask me, people go home from college for one of two reasons: 
1. To actually take a break and think about stuff
2. Because there's nothing to do back in their college town and they don't want to be the one person alone in their dorm

I have no problem being alone

In fact, I wouldn't mind if I was alone in the apartment for a few days

As long as I wasn't there the whole day, only in the evenings

-

BARBIE WAS FIRE BRUH

The claim is true, it's not just a meme

I was cracking up during da movie üòÇ

Some scenes were so absurd or dumb that they were funny

The colors of each world did a good job illustrating the contrast 

Super saturated pink pastels vs ordinary black, gray, brown, and it's interesting to note the real world was LA

(which you'd think would be sunny but I guess it isn't irl bc of smog)

And the message was surprisingly meaningful too

I got kinda mad that I was the only one from my apartment going 

But it's okay

Some people can't recognize hidden gems

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Aug 13, 2023:** 

Back to coding...

-

It didn't save any of my edits. I'm mad üò°

-

Basically, yesterday Pastor Ed came to give us the Sunday message

It was about how God wants to give us a joyful life and the servants have the most fun loving others

And how often people let good become the enemy of great, trading heaven and following Jesus for land (wealth), oxen (power), and marriage (love) 

As CS Lewis puts it, our desires are far too weak and we cannot comprehend that God wants to give us something greater than anything we've known (or have context for)

-

First summer study session at Rodriguez et al. residence 

and summer supper with da boys since BLin returned

Jeremiah Lim was like "I guess you guys didn't want to come to the banquet" in the chat

but it was at that moment that I climbed over the rail

haha

-

If college is considered having a lot of time bc u don't have to work yet

then I can only imagine how little time work leaves you with

Like is it just gonna be get home and eat dinner, maybe veg out on the couch, sleep, and the next day same thing?

People make it seem like it's gonna be soooo fun to work

I mean, if you like your job then yes

But otherwise, it's gonna be a huge time sink

Part of me wants to believe that the only reason certain people work in the summer

Is because they don't know how to productively manage their time otherwise

And they don't want to look unproductive

But we all know they're not doing THAT MUCH on the job

And yes we all care so much about your experience with customers and mundane tasks


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Aug 14, 2023:** 

I have all the time I could ever need

it's merely a matter of making the best use of it

(=> It's not how much time you have, but what you do with it)

But you already knew that

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Aug 15, 2023:**

I took an L on PA1

Well, I need to sleep now bc stressing about it when you're tired does nothing

and affects your future performance

Let it go

Don't waste your lunch or library time

I know the Crooked Man series is fun to watch 

and that there are many genres of music to explore

but

it doesn't have to be rn

those activities are not absolutely requisite

I know you find this hard to believe, Paul

but u can still live w/o CK and music

Trust me

And they're not going to disappear anytime soon

-

Thought I had the panda rewards offer still but it must have expired

I took another L, but not for the crooked man

Stayed too long watching YouTube in PC

I need to pick only one YT video to watch, nothing more

in fact, one longer video actually might take up less time than a bunch of shorter ones

-

I wish I could spend more time outdoors breathing fresh air

Instead I'm cooped up in the library programming

or learning about algorithms for task assignment or scheduling

and polynomials and fractions and ring homomorphisms

(I really need to spend more time on cse101 since it's the harder of the two)

Which isn't bad

it's fun at times 

mainly, it's hard to get focused

If only I could commit fully and not be distracted by trivial things  

And also my legs get stiff after a while from sitting

so I'll walk along the bookshelf aisles or drink water or use the restroom

There's AC and a nice view but not really anyone to talk to

Solo elevator rides are really great, but lately I've been running into more people who need to take the elevator

so I might have to go back to the stairs just to get some alone time and exercise

-

Looks like I need either a walk in nature or a run on the treadmill

I know the library is like my second home but it's starting to get a little old

staying in the same place for too long, no matter where, will surely make me go mad

Being able to move around a large area keeps me sane

Back in quarantine, I'd often pace my bedroom but that's not very large

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Aug 18, 2023:**

Nearly finished with _Mere Christianity_

It's amazing how much you can read by listening to audiobooks

Like last yr there was Huck Finn, Pinocchio, and The Mark of Zorro

This year there was Animorphs and Welcome to Dead House

As for physical books, _Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!_, _Gospel_ by JD Greer,

and _A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23_

-

Another thing: for people who say they like reading

You notice how they rarely mention which genre? 

I mean, I like reading books but it had better be a certified classic

like American literature or international classics like Crime and Punishment or The Metamorphosis or Don Quixote

or if it gives good insight into human nature or Christian life or just life tips and wisdom 

I used to be super into science fiction, adventure, and horror a lot more so stuff like Animorphs, 39 Clues, Goosebumps, How to Train Your Dragon

Fantasy not as much (although I did read Magic Tree House for a bit and also the Hobbit and LOTR and Harry Potter and forced myself to watch GOT)

idk, I guess I thought stuff about knights, castles, dragons, kings, and princesses was too archaic to be entertaining

Now I'm more into historical fiction so if your novel is set against the backdrop of the 1800s for instance (whether it be the Civil War, steamboats and trains, fur trapping, the Oregon Trail, Homestead Act, Trail of Tears, etc but that's just in America), I'll be interested to read in order to learn more about life back then

If you want to get into international stuff, there was Charles Darwin's voyage on the HMS Beagle, development of electromagnetism as a branch of science, Weierstrass' work on analysis in real and complex numbers, Mendeleev creates the periodic table, J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron, first commercial automobile sold, Thomas Edison patents the lightbulb, Rudolf Clausius' formulation of the 2nd law of thermodynamics, etc.

There's also more to be said about what happened culturally and historically but that's for another time

It's my favorite century in history, can you tell?

No praise practice this weekend bc of SDSU outreach

A relief to be sure

Today was my first time talking to SDSU students

The demographic was much different, fewer Asians

it looked like what you would expect to see in an American suburb in the 50s

I'm not too great at conversation when it's just me

Flyering is more my thing bc the interaction is brief and you can get lots of practice trying to pitch something to different people

-

I for real almost called an Uber to get to SDSU

then I changed my mind and thought about taking the trolley for an hour

but finally I messaged the GP chat and got a ride with Jonny, Spencer, and Tobi

-

Salt & Straw post activity

Cinammon and Honey Fried chicken was alright, but then it got so salty that I was puckering up

Blackberry birthday cake was good until it was just blackberry jam

The price you pay for novelty ice cream flavors

Should have gone with just sour cherry pie tbh

-

Hurricane Hilary is approaching

Will be praying that it either goes west and misses us or will not be too severe

-

It's a shame we don't really handwrite letters anymore

There's something more personal about seeing someone's written words than reading texts/emails

-

This fruit fly problem is getting out of hand 

-

I've found I detest staying up and doing meaningless activities to pass the time

It's painful to stay up after some point

like you're not even entertained

the videos aren't making you laugh anymore

so the best option is just to exit all the tabs and head to bed

4a late-night revelations? 

No, more like not thinking straight

-

I used to hate mornings and sunlight back in high school

Now I realize the real reason is because I was sleep-deprived

so really I only hated light and the waking hours bc I was half-dead

Stomach burning from the xtra spicy calamari combo with pepper powder and sriracha

Had to take tums and a nap

I got up earlier than usual today (6:30a) for 7a Viewridge DT

No more crazy amounts of spice for now

It's not good for your stomach and nobody asked you to do it bruh

Fish burrito got old

also many playlists are getting old

music is no longer what keeps things fresh

you can listen to different music in the same place but it's not THAT different

being in new places helps you think more differently

-

Rested up, slept around 9 hrs

-

Thank God for the library bc I hate having to do work at home when certain people are super loud on Discord

Bc I totally needed to be updated on every single time you died and whether some guy needs to provide support

-

Heart melted today

when I saw videos of children in Korea bringing gifts to adults

I know it's a social experiment 

but still think I would cry if a kid gave me a hug

Because their intentions are so pure

there's nothing behind it like expecting you to do something for them in return

-

I won't let you

THE FIRST PROBLEM FOR M103B HW9 IS DRIVING ME INSANE

AM I JUST SUPPOSED TO GUESS A RING HOMOMORPHISM FROM R TO S THAT WORKS????

ONLY HINT WAS 1ST ISOMORPHISM THEOREM MIGHT BE HELPFUL

VERY HELPFUL HINT

NOT

&nbsp;

HW9 problem 1 solved

It wasn't too bad after reviewing cosets

Didn't use the First Isom Thm at all though

-

Haven't had a home-cooked meal in so long

need fresh vegetables

literally just been eating on campus food for the past two days

-

Well today's PA on Moore-Hodgson Algorithm is gonna be fun üôÉ

-

Art of Inclusive Communication workshop starts in < 1 hr

I'll have to be at home for that bc even though the M1's battery life is good

It's not enough for 3 hrs of an online Zoom meeting bc that drains A LOT of power

-

Was feeling anxious this morning

Had to listen to some calming music

Piano/classical music really helps

**Aug 24, 2023:**

I really dislike getting pestered with questions over text that lead nowhere

Like "oh! where are you now? Whatcha up to rn? Your apt? Campus?"

It's one of the two, yes

How that affects anything I'm not sure

My daily life is not something to be too interested over

I'm not some vlogger

It's rather routine

That's why if your text isn't important

I'll answer at most one of your queries per day

-

Unless it's a social event

I don't talk just to talk

-

Also saying "nvm" after a text that isn't relevant anymore is a common courtesy

I used to think that was weird/cringe, but it just lets the other person know they don't have to answer anymore

-

Just please leave me alone man

I can hardly go more than a few days before you message me

This is getting ridiculous

Like I said, I need personal time

-

Getting out of bed felt so difficult today

I was tired

The good sleeping streak would have continued

But one night I forgot to shower earlier and had to wait for someone to finish their shower

and they take some time

One day of sleeping at 3a destroys a good sleeping habit

Fortunately, the shower thing won't be a problem soon

Once saturday night rolls around, it'll be just me!

For that shower at least

-

If it weren't for the whole job application thing and family asking me about it

and Ed being back at home expecting me to hang out like EVERY day

and the shadow of the past thing

Maybe I'd go back home again this summer

-

When I go home in Thanksgiving, I'll be sure to try to slip into the bay unnoticed

Or if I absolutely have to disclose it, to make one thing clear: 

I came back mainly for family and personal time to reflect, not hanging out with you

It's really a drain on me to be honest

All I need is maybe a few days of being at the park and outside in nature

Not just the suburbs

I actually prefer FaceTime calling Ed bc I can do stuff on the side

and there's geographic separation

If it's in-person, I'm expected to be way more engaged

-

It's getting a bit lonely here in SD

Everyone's gone or leaving pretty much

But it's been nice seeing what goes on behind the scenes

when people return in the fall like wow! so much has changed!!

And you're just like uh-huh yep we know

................................................................................................................................................

I shouldn't have expected Ed to understand

Some things people can't understand

until they've walked a certain path long enough

not to say that I'm a better person

but as a Christian, there's a certain way my life changed

-

Why did I try to justify my ways according to what the world says?

Like I said the old high school friends moved on naturally

and I got excluded from the conversation

which didn't feel good

but is at least better than them intentionally cutting me off

-

I don't really talk to them anymore

But we change and grow, and move on

I'll still cherish good memories we had together

stuff like "the pen" and track and preparing for ap exams and funny moments like changing people's backgrounds to their faces or roasting people or the meme docs

and those deep talks and stuff at Mt Hermon

Although they couldn't be with me forever, I'm glad they could be a part of my life

-

A person who constantly hates others cannot truly be happy, right?

At least that's what psychologists say

-

Personally, in that very moment last December, I would have wanted nothing more than to never to talk to any of them again and hope they feel excluded from some conversation and understand exactly how I felt, and also see that what they did was hurtful

But God doesn't view us based on our mistakes

And Jesus said to love our enemies, not just our friends

(side note: one of the most loving things you can do is pray for the plans of the wicked to fail since it may be that in their frustration, or despair, they turn to God)

If He did, then Israel would have been destroyed long ago

because they turned away from Him so many times

even after He saved them so many times and provided for their needs

I used to think this was comical, as if I would have definitely been different

but in many ways, I am no different

How many times do I forget what God has provided me with and how He led me?

Life could have turned out very differently

I didn't have to be born in America

I didn't have to have parents that love me and have stable incomees

I didn't have to have awesome teachers in elementary, jr high, and high school

I didn't have to come to San Diego for college

I didn't have to meet a group of believers

I didn't have to have the use of my limbs or have all my five senses

I didn't have to be of a height that is normal, not super tall but not super short either

How many times do I doubt that He can help when I pray to Him?

-

When Ed mentioned that he feels nothing but hatred towards Remi, part of me was angry that this is how he felt

I suppose part of me wanted to believe he knew how to act better

that he was supposed to act Christian

But we can't hold non-Christians to the same standard as Christians

It's disheartening for sure, because I know that we're not supposed to live according to our own desires and hate people

But even God, though he cannot tolerate sin, does not force everyone on Earth to love and obey Him

That would serve justice, but we wouldn't be able to have a relationship with Him

for otherwise, we would not have free will

In order to truly love, we need to have the choice to reject

-

Sometimes I feel like I'm too legalistic

like bc someone didn't do this thing like help out with outreach, they're not a "true Christian"

but you can do many good things for God 

without truly knowing Him

Not to say that it would be better if we did nothing than do things without full conviction

It's good to do good things because they're good

But we don't do bad things for the sake of being bad, only to gain something good

(see C.S. Lewis' _Mere Christianity_ or St. Augustine's _Confessions_)

................................................................................................................................................

PSST. Hey me! It's really great that you know exactly what I mean without me having to explain so much context. Really, it gets frustrating sometimes talking to others. And every little inside joke or comment or subtle thing about me you already know. Perks of being you huh!

Earlier today, I thought I would be able to de-stress by talking to Ed. But it actually ended up making me more stressed because he was bringing up the whole communication thing and it just gets me a bit annoyed because I have to come to terms with the fact that I'm not super talkative. I mean, clear communication is important, but I'd rather not feel obligated to talk to EVERYBODY 24/7 if you know what I mean. Like I didn't know I had to check in on you every day. I only have so much time and energy you know! Let me recharge first and then we can talk. And it's like I'm the weird one for not wanting to be around people all the time?? Listen, I know some people are extroverts but that doesn't give you the right to say what is and isn't conventional. Plus, why do people think this is bad if it's only for a little bit? OH NO HE'S GOING TO BE ALONE FOR A LITTLE BIT I HOPE HE'LL BE OKAY. I haven't had an entire day of being alone since well, last summer. But back then I didn't really embrace the alone time. It was more like here we go again. Another day with no one to hang out with üôÉ. You know what bruh? Who gave people the right to say being by yourself for some time is not allowed? What if I want to be alone for a little bit? Is it a crime?? Do I have to socialize every single second of the day? Also who says you need to have fifty friends back at home. What if it's just my place to reflect on my life and spend time with family?

This makes me appreciate the time on campus learning alone much more because I don't have to answer any bothersome inquiries about what I'm doing (I KNOW RIGHT?? LIKE I'LL BE READING A BOOK AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ASK??? Hmmm, it could be any number of things.... ISN'T IT OBVIOUS????).
It's really a shame that the library doesn't open earlier though. Being with people a lot, you start to notice certain things that rub you the wrong way. Like hearing Bryan yelling into a mic about his teammates' performance. Because I definitely need more of that in my life. And he'll just respond to a passing comment I make like I wasn't talking to you bruh, I'm just mad I missed this railgun shot. How would you like it if everytime you say something into the mic I asked for the exact logical reason for it? First of all, I won't do that because I simply do not care enough about overwatch or whatever and second of all, you think I have time for that?? I would need to be extremely bored to start talking about all that.

Right now, I can think, uninterrupted about many different things. I can close my eyes and pretend for a little bit, that I'm in my own little world where people can't bother me. The silence...it's beautiful. Music to my ears. Ahhhh. One awesome thing about college is that there aren't really cliques and stuff on campus. Walk alone, eat alone, take the bus alone, go to class alone. You can do many things alone without people looking at you funny. It's even better if you're a dude because people don't usually go up to you and start conversations.
