**July 07, 2023:** 

hey. been a while .. ðŸ™ƒ

&nbsp;

I realized this is easier to update and read than the journal

Since I can type faster and more legibly than I can write

Allowing me to describe things at greater lengths

But anyways

here's what happened today 

-

Called Ed on FaceTime, he was ranting about how Tristan was being unreasonable based on his interpretation of the story

In other news, he agrees with Marcus Aurelius' quote that the quality of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts
(e.g. to not be depressed, don't think about depressing things). Gee? Who knew!

He hates SoCal btw 

I disagree 

The weather's nice, I have church family here, puts distance between me and home, 
and I can take it slower out here just to name a few things.

-

Finally finished the breakfast burrito that was in the fridge since last Sat

Went to Geisel Summer Table for the first time 

Read a little bit of Walden (ok just the foreword and part of the intro)

-

Softball game was a striking success ðŸ¥Ž

Ran to home 2x, got out once 

Caught a pop fly

-

Finished _A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23_

Did a Hot Ones interview, but thankfully the questions weren't too serious

And the wings weren't too bad, at most 40% of the Supreme

Well, one asked what do I want to be written on my tombstone. 

I said "Fully spent torch" as in I gave everything I had and burned brightly as I lived

-

Played Saboteur

Got exposed on the first round bc I was one saboteur against the world :(

Second round there were three saboteurs so we easily won xP

**July 11, 2023:** 

I know what you're thinking, but we didn't get a free 7-Eleven slurpee

Just a used bike and some stuff from Ranch 99 

Well

I guess I should mention why that particular Ranch 99 has a special significance..

It was the first Ranch 99 I visited with Dad coming down to SD for FA21 and moving into my Mirada apartment. It was there I got my rewards card (which they don't accept up in NorCal like c'mon bruh)

To be honest, I'm not really mad even though it's Seven Eleven day. Losing a free item isn't that bad since there's no cost for getting it

Ok technically, there's still a cost bc we would have to drive there and it takes time which we'll never get back 

So nothing is really free

-

Guess what arrived today? 

Da North American Wildlife poster we ordered back in June ! ðŸŒ²ðŸ¦ŒðŸ¦¬ 

which we thought got lost in transit

Gideon already got refunded for it so hopefully they don't charge extra

Since I have no use for two of the same poster

this shall be a gift

A random visit to campus Target revealed the missing pieces of the puzzle 

U know how there were the collectible GOTGV3 cereal boxes in stores from May?

Well, here is the complete set 

1. Reese's Puffs -> Rocket Raccoon

2. Cinammon Toast Crunch -> Peter Quill

3. Cookie Crisp -> Nebula

4. Trix -> Drax

5. Honey Nut Cheerios -> Mantis

6. Lucky Charms -> Groot

7. (Bonus) GOTGV3 cereal with all of them: cocoa puffs and mini marshmallows

*Speaking of GOTGV3, the HD version of the movie came out on FMovies already so now Mike and Ed can watch

- 

Tostada night was a success! 

I was stuffed after only eating two and also we had to rush to Pryr Mtg after 

First time riding in Johnny (Eli's car) w Ryan as driver

It was weird.

Seeing Gideon not moving his arms to steer, that is

---

Anyways I hope there's no funny business on Friday's midterm
