**July 07, 2023:** 

hey. been a while .. üôÉ

&nbsp;

I realized this is easier to update and read than the journal

Since I can type faster and more legibly than I can write

Allowing me to describe things at greater lengths

But anyways

here's what happened today 

-

Called Ed on FaceTime, he was ranting about how Tristan was being unreasonable based on his interpretation of the story

In other news, he agrees with Marcus Aurelius' quote that the quality of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts
(e.g. to not be depressed, don't think about depressing things). Gee? Who knew!

He hates SoCal btw 

I disagree 

The weather's nice, I have church family here, puts distance between me and home, 
and I can take it slower out here just to name a few things.

-

Finally finished the breakfast burrito that was in the fridge since last Sat

Went to Geisel Summer Table for the first time 

Read a little bit of Walden (ok just the foreword and part of the intro)

-

Softball game was a striking success ü•é

Ran to home 2x, got out once 

Caught a pop fly

-

Finished _A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23_

Did a Hot Ones interview, but thankfully the questions weren't too serious

And the wings weren't too bad, at most 40% of the Supreme

Well, one asked what do I want to be written on my tombstone. 

I said "Fully spent torch" as in I gave everything I had and burned brightly as I lived

-

Played Saboteur

Got exposed on the first round bc I was one saboteur against the world :(

Second round there were three saboteurs so we easily won xP

**July 11, 2023:** 

I know what you're thinking, but we didn't get a free 7-Eleven slurpee

Just a used bike and some stuff from Ranch 99 

Well

I guess I should mention why that particular Ranch 99 has a special significance..

It was the first Ranch 99 I visited with Dad coming down to SD for FA21 and moving into my Mirada apartment. It was there I got my rewards card (which they don't accept up in NorCal like c'mon bruh)

&nbsp;

Today (Jul 11, 2023)

To be honest, I'm not really mad even though it's Seven Eleven day. Losing a free item isn't that bad since there's no cost for getting it

Ok technically, there's still a cost bc we would have to drive there and it takes time which we'll never get back 

So nothing is really free

-

Guess what arrived today? 

Da North American Wildlife poster we ordered back in June ! üå≤ü¶åü¶¨ 

which we thought got lost in transit

Gideon already got refunded for it so hopefully they don't charge extra

Since I have no use for two of the same poster

this shall be a gift

-

A random visit to campus Target revealed the missing pieces of the puzzle 

U know how there were the collectible GOTGV3 cereal boxes in stores from May?

Well, here is the complete set 

1. Reese's Puffs -> Rocket Raccoon

2. Cinammon Toast Crunch -> Peter Quill

3. Cookie Crisp -> Nebula

4. Trix -> Drax

5. Honey Nut Cheerios -> Mantis

6. Lucky Charms -> Groot

7. (Bonus) GOTGV3 cereal with all of them: cocoa puffs and mini marshmallows

*Speaking of GOTGV3, the HD version of the movie came out on FMovies already so now Mike and Ed can watch

-

Tostada night was a success! 

I was stuffed after only eating two and also we had to rush to Pryr Mtg after 

First time riding in Johnny (Eli's car) w Ryan as driver

It was weird.

Seeing Gideon not moving his arms to steer, that is

---

Anyways I hope there's no funny business on Friday's midterm

Tu-Th felt like one long Thursday

-

Met Provost Paul Yu for the first time

I enjoyed the conversation

Got a nifty calculator 

-

Is it weird that I've seen my professors outside the classroom many times? 

(Like at the bus stop or getting groceries or walking around campus)

I feel like saying something but at the same time they probably don't know me like that

-

Fried pork cutlet with shredded cabbage for dinner tonight

Didn't watch Indiana Jones but I'm sure we didn't miss out too much right?

**July 15, 2023:** 

I kind of got angry when Ed said it's good to expand your interests because I took it to mean he thought my interests weren't diverse enough

And that got me thinking, how much is enough? Be interested in everything you like? Master all the subjects in the world? Talk to every type of person in the world? Don't you know that I only have a finite amount of time on this Earth and can only keep up with so many things?

Part of me gets angry that I seem to be benefitting from the friendship more than he is and doesn't often take my advice on stuff. But I guess my life experience is not so much based on talking with people about stuff but doing things on my own. Which is important for getting stuff done but not really for relationships with others. So you can be a good worker or student but be a poor conversationalist.

I also got angry when Ed said SoCal is the worst place to live in because I'm currently living there like why you gotta send shots like that. Keep that to yourself man

Think I need a break from that guy because he's kind of pissing me off always asking about my social life and when I'm coming back to the bay area. As if I wasn't already there so often last year. Just because you hate SoCal doesn't mean everyone has to hate it. But similarly, just because I like it doesn't mean everyone has to like it

And you think your entire life is about money and finding the woman of your dreams? Don't you realize that there's more to life than that? More than just comfort and ease?  

It's hard to be patient and deal with people who don't really understand you. Or know you. I don't think he knows me to be honest. He might think he does, but there are parts of me that he simply wouldn't understand. Maybe he'll never understand. It's okay. 

This is exactly why there are cameras to talk to and journals and personal websites to write down exactly what you're thinking without having to explain in painstaking detail exactly what you mean. Conversations are cool but sometimes you don't want to go through the trouble of giving all the context for something.

Because really this is just expressing how I feel to myself. I know what I mean. 

To talk about something that happened is no problem but to have to explain all of it when it appears very obvious to me is kind of arduous. 

For example, to understand why I like rural areas more than urban ones, you would probably have to know something about my trip to Indiana and how I read many books about wilderness survival when I was younger and how I like the sun and fresh air and hate being indoors when it's super sunny outside. And I guess some of Tyler's music played a part in making me like traveling and nature. Also how nature evokes a sense of awe and wonder which is really an inconsolable longing for heaven, our true home.

But to myself, I can simply say: The explanation of this is trivial (bc I already knew all of the context I mentioned)

I hate feeling like I have to justify why I'm not weird to people. I get that not everything I do is considered conventional but can't you see that the motivation for such things is quite understandable? I'm not an alien. I'm a human. 

I make mistakes. I have dreams. I feel emotion.

Looking at me in a funny way and making me feel like I'm weird is exactly what made me angry. Because who gave you the right to decide that what I'm like is unusual? Or who gave you the right to be the judge of whether my life is spent in a meaningful way? Or who gave you the right to decide what's acceptable and what's not? Who said college life has to be the way you say it has to be? Who said you have to have a friend group that goes all over the place? Who says that I have to return to NorCal so often? Who says I have to spend my time talking to you? 

NOBODY.

DO I MAKE YOU TALK ABOUT WHATEVER I LIKE EVEN IF YOU DON'T GET IT? 

GO AHEAD. MAKE MY DAY. ASK ME ABOUT MOLECULAR ORBITALS. 

OR DARBOUX SUMS 

OR THE HANDSHAKING LEMMA

OR THE WELL ORDERING PRINCIPLE. OR SUP'S AND INF'S 

OR PROBABILITY RULES 

I'LL WAIT.

... 

YEAH I THOUGHT SO.

-

Don't you just hate it when someone else thinks they have the right to tell you that what you like is weird as if they're somehow the unquestionable authority on what is acceptable or not like do you actually think everyone else thinks like you? My life isn't the same as yours and it was never meant to be

-

Is my assessment correct or am I getting angry over something small and not recognizing that my view is possibly incorrect and the other view possibly has some truth to it? 

"Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you;

reprove a wise man, and he will love \ you"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proverbs 10:9 (ESV)

-

It's hard to love people who make you angry

And more generally those who you don't think did anything to deserve love in the first place

-

And to accept truths about yourself which you don't like

And finding the strength to keep going when you fail again and again

**July 21, 2023:** 

Gideon left today, bringing poster with him

Learned about the importance of prayer and good habits to prepare for storms of life

Brownie pie at Up2U Cafe was too sweet

Sneak peak of Viewridge


&nbsp; 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**July 22, 2023:** 

Full day of work

McDonald's for breakfast

Moved touchscreen TV with Trip and Jason

Assembled stools

Moved fridge with Jeff, Jason, Jack, John Choi, and John Corea

Sichuan beef and vegetables for lunch

Helped Jeremiah install the Nest thermostats

Trash duty in Chad's truck

Came back for In-N-Out burgers 

My shoe patch failed me again, exposed my sock

Praise practice 

Jenny's ice cream

Exhausted, slept around 12

&nbsp; 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**July 23, 2023:**

First time on praise 

I didn't know the intro for King of Kings was right off the bat

Katsu dinner at the Rodriguez, Wellenkamp, Brex, Jeong, et. al residence

&nbsp; 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**July 26, 2023:** 

I didn't know that the song "I Ain't Worried" was from Top Gun: Maverick

2014 RPG horror game era from CoryXKenshin is appealing to me more than his recent stuff bc it feels like he's more genuine in a sense. Not as much editing and he interacted more with fans. Now it's kind of not the same but I understand that we all get older and can't be stuck in the past 

-

I didn't know chimps were super aggressive killers

but Gorillas and Orangutans are chill apparently

-

Almost lost my sanity to the prison of my own mind

I was working on Hw6 for hours after coming back home, mostly just on Problem 3

Calculating confidence intervals and p-values for hypothesis tests for the differences in proportions..

Thankfully I didn't miss the zoom meeting for the AYM tech camp at 9p 

I hope I can show care and compassion tmrw

When, knowing myself, I might find myself feeling like learning about code is more interesting

But it's not just about coding, it's about people

Can't miss the alarm tomorrow 

Besides, I like the fresh morning air 

I'm sure you don't need me to tell you about how stuffy the apartment can get

-

Just listening to some of the Late Night playlist 

I'm training myself to view 00:00 as the dead of night

Now I use 24-hr time bc it's simpler to read

Texts Go Green was not too difficult to make super clean

Passionfruit instrumental is very soothing
