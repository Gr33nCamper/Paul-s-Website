My earlier writing wasn't saved after switching tab groups. I'm infuriated.

Jk guys, I mainly just talked about how the really low humidity was doing a number on me bc I was guzzling water and my lips were still dry. And you know how Sichuan is super humid? I'm not advocating for any rainforest weather but â‰¥ 50% humidity seems more reasonable than the 37% we have right now. 

Yesterday, Sebastian and I got Ridgewalk Social burgers. Discovered RS sauce itself has a citrus tang, not the burger itself. It was my first meal of that day and the outdoor dining was very comfortable, except for the fly and yellowjackets buzzing around. Also I'm headed to Riverside to visit Ed for Veterans Day weekend, which marks my first long-term departure from SD since June. I know Sebastian and I went on hikes in the surrounding cities this summer and I spent quite some time alone in Geisel or near SunGod lawn or in the park during summer but it didn't really feel like a true escape bc people I know can still reach me so it's like come on bruh, I want to REALLY escape and reset for some time. Then when I return home, I can view life with fresh eyes. 

Also this winter, I'm no longer tripping over old high school friends. I'm so over it. No more connections to old friends bc they've sadly either changed in unfavorable ways (became frat guys) or just got super busy and it's like I'm only in Fremont a few weeks out of the year so it's really not worth maintaining or forging connections with people when there's not even regular contact. Because although I'm beginning to see that time goes by super fast now, it's also true that people can drastically change in as little as a month or two so imagine how much someone can change in the course of half a year or a year.

Also I'm thinking I'll go to the sunday service in Riverside. And regarding the winter road trip to Oregon and Washington, I think perhaps I'll visit Mr. Garcia and also the Seattle ministry.
