Sometimes when I go to the moon ðŸŒ•

I can't help but think about youuuuu ðŸ¥²ðŸ‘‹

Yes, I know it didn't start at Oct 01, but I'm done with making things so neat and tidy when in reality they're not so clean. Just wanted to get some of my thoughts down undisturbed. I've been feeling a little burned out and stressed since last week. Getting up at 8a is killer. Joe and pastries were practically the only two things getting me through the day other than prayer and being around others. I mean, I hardly got a chance to really be alone and do some of my own stuff without being around others or on the clock. Is it wrong to feel this way? I know we're meant to be the body of Christ and all but does that really equate with being held hostage and not being allowed to leave and go places alone to think? Am I really expected to have infinite energy? I'm so done with putting on an unnatural act and holding myself to an unrealistic standard. It feels like I'm Martha and I'm so busy doing things without really thinking about the purpose behind them. Like even during the Welcome Night, I don't think I really got to connect with many new people and Ed being around didn't make it any easier. Tbh, that's a whole nother thing bc it feels like we're not even that close anymore. He's been acting different ever since he's been hanging around with Syndy and idk if I like that. He's been acting like he's too cool for the old bro stuff and isn't very willing to learn new stuff whether about religion or different viewpoints, but simply assumes that he knows more bc he talks to more people. And even after the gospel skit he was like I already knew Ok bro, yeah we get it. You (think you) know everything. But I guess everybody moves on..

Now the apartment situation is like this:
Ryan's been in a foul mood ever since I told him I've been appointed to join the Geisel council of elders bc he thinks it's strayed too far from its original purpose, but he's been very vague about what that's supposed to mean and I think he expects me to somehow deduce this. Now I like solving problems but come on now, this does not appear so obvious that an explanation is so trivial. It's like in writing if you don't explain your evidence enough, then your reader has to analyze your analysis, meaning your analysis was not very good.

Bryan's been out of commission since school ended pretty much, not going to many events. It's gotten to the point where people at church think he's left for home, but really he's just been playing on his PC and working at the bookstore. So idk, on paper I guess he looks like he's part of our group. But if you ask me, very few of his actions support that he's been changed as a Christian and in fact his life is not much different from that of a nonbeliever except for some Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays.

Gideon has covid, so he's been quarantining since he's returned. He's kind of out of the loop about what happened in the past two weeks. But I'm confident we'll be able to pick up quickly from where we left off.

Then there's also this senior meeting Ryan wants to do where we're getting everyone on the same page. Something tells me this isn't going to be a very fun meeting but will involve awkward confrontations and bringing truth to light. Some people might get a bitter taste of unsweetened coffee. Or maybe these truths will be dipped in so much sugar just to be palatable. 

Growing up is tough, but man, I didn't think I still had so much growing up to do. Well, if you don't think you need to grow, then you won't do things that will help you grow. Just like if you think everything is exactly as you think it is, you won't be open to hearing new perspectives and changing your viewpoints.

Music is excellent for calming down.

Speaking of which, here's a short freestyle I wrote on Sunday before Welcome Night, plus a few new lines. It's called "Ballroom Improvisation" and is meant to be rapped over the beat of another improvisation associated with a horizontal platform ;)

PC Ballroom going volcanic

PC Ballroom going (what?)

PC Ballroom going volcanic

&nbsp;

First scene exit on the right

Last scene eve of Christmas, white

Last night got into a fight

My homie almost took flight

'pologies set things alright

Certain truths were brought to light

&nbsp;

Lots of people over here

Excitement, it fills the air

Faces look familiar

Talk to people, yes we care

I'm not perfect sin ain't fair

&nbsp;

Bro think he know everything

Books stacked up right on the shelf

Closes mind, relies on self

Met new girl, they often sing

It's like to him I don't exist

Past follows me, they insist

People change and we move on

Let's remember 'fore it's gone

&nbsp;

Too much pain

Too much fight

One more day

One more day

&nbsp;

Too much loss

Too much cost

One more play

One more play

&nbsp;

(end)

Now to dive into the word for some DT

Moods pass, coding got me super focused and thinking again. Ping pong got me wanting to practice my loop and get more consistent with returning the ball
