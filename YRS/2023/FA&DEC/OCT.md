Sometimes when I go to the moon ðŸŒ•

I can't help but think about youuuuu ðŸ¥²ðŸ‘‹

Yes, I know it didn't start at Oct 01, but I'm done with making things so neat and tidy when in reality they're not so clean. Just wanted to get some of my thoughts down undisturbed. I've been feeling a little burned out and stressed since last week. Getting up at 8a is killer. Joe and pastries were practically the only two things getting me through the day other than prayer and being around others. I mean, I hardly got a chance to really be alone and do some of my own stuff without being around others or on the clock. Is it wrong to feel this way? I know we're meant to be the body of Christ and all but does that really equate with being held hostage and not being allowed to leave and go places alone to think? Am I really expected to have infinite energy? I'm so done with putting on an unnatural act and holding myself to an unrealistic standard. It feels like I'm Martha and I'm so busy doing things without really thinking about the purpose behind them. Like even during the Welcome Night, I don't think I really got to connect with many new people and Ed being around didn't make it any easier. Tbh, that's a whole nother thing bc it feels like we're not even that close anymore. He's been acting different ever since he's been hanging around with Syndy and idk if I like that. He's been acting like he's too cool for the old bro stuff and isn't very willing to learn new stuff whether about religion or different viewpoints, but simply assumes that he knows more bc he talks to more people. And even after the gospel skit he was like I already knew Ok bro, yeah we get it. You (think you) know everything. But I guess everybody moves on..

Now the apartment situation is like this:
Ryan's been in a foul mood ever since I told him I've been appointed to join the Geisel council of elders bc he thinks it's strayed too far from its original purpose, but he's been very vague about what that's supposed to mean and I think he expects me to somehow deduce this. Now I like solving problems but come on now, this does not appear so obvious that an explanation is so trivial. It's like in writing if you don't explain your evidence enough, then your reader has to analyze your analysis, meaning your analysis was not very good.

Bryan's been out of commission since school ended pretty much, not going to many events. It's gotten to the point where people at church think he's left for home, but really he's just been playing on his PC and working at the bookstore. So idk, on paper I guess he looks like he's part of our group. But if you ask me, very few of his actions support that he's been changed as a Christian and in fact his life is not much different from that of a nonbeliever except for some Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays.

Gideon has covid, so he's been quarantining since he's returned. He's kind of out of the loop about what happened in the past two weeks. But I'm confident we'll be able to pick up quickly from where we left off.

Then there's also this senior meeting Ryan wants to do where we're getting everyone on the same page. Something tells me this isn't going to be a very fun meeting but will involve awkward confrontations and bringing truth to light. Some people might get a bitter taste of unsweetened coffee. Or maybe these truths will be dipped in so much sugar just to be palatable. 

Growing up is tough, but man, I didn't think I still had so much growing up to do. Well, if you don't think you need to grow, then you won't do things that will help you grow. Just like if you think everything is exactly as you think it is, you won't be open to hearing new perspectives and changing your viewpoints.

Music is excellent for calming down.

Speaking of which, here's a short freestyle I wrote on Sunday before Welcome Night, plus a few new lines. It's called "Ballroom Improvisation" and is meant to be rapped over the beat of another improvisation associated with a horizontal platform ;)

PC Ballroom going volcanic

PC Ballroom going (what?)

PC Ballroom going volcanic

&nbsp;

First scene exit on the right

Last scene eve of Christmas, white

Last night got into a fight

My homie almost took flight

'pologies set things alright

Certain truths were brought to light

&nbsp;

Lots of people over here

Excitement, it fills the air

Faces look familiar

Joy and sadness both we share

Talk to people, yes we care

I'm not perfect sin ain't fair

&nbsp;

Bro think he know everything

Books stacked up right on the shelf

Closes mind, relies on self

Met new girl, they often sing

It's like to him I don't exist

Past follows me, they insist

People change and we move on

Let's remember 'fore it's gone

&nbsp;

Too much pain

Too much fight

One more day

One more day

&nbsp;

Too much loss

Too much cost

One more play

One more play

&nbsp;

(end)

Now to dive into the word for some DT

Moods pass, coding got me super focused and thinking again. Ping pong got me wanting to practice my loop and get more consistent with returning the ball

Some guy was tailing me on the stairs up to Geisel and was still going past the fifth floor. I was taking stairs two at a time and he was still pretty close behind so I was like ðŸ˜¬ come on man, just get off on your floor already. Please!

Okay, time to briefly read Psalms DTfinish Chm142 hw1. In < 2hrs.

My inner sheep is beginning to bring about my own ruin. Like idk why I was up so late Tues night editing my music library, adding new beats to playlists and editing playlist covers. This caused a whole cascade effect since this caused me to not get enough sleep and actually that's still affecting me rn. I'm on around 2 hrs of sleep hahahahaha (Someone help me). Since I didn't go to bed early enough, I didn't get up early enough to comfortably finish a prelab or do DT or anything, so I only got it done only around 5 min before the deadline of 11:30. Then I was like 10 min late to lab, and bc I had rushed through the prelab, I wasn't super sure what we were supposed to do. Thankfully, Sebastian and I ended early enough to grab a bite to eat at Subway (which we had to do since I had neither brkfst nor lunch). But then I was ~20 min late for M187A lecture. And you know me, I have a new policy that I will show up to every lab or lecture possible, even if I'm late. But it's really kind of awkward to find a seat when everyone else is already seated and no open seats are at the back. It feels like I have a microphone on me so every zipper opening sounds WAY louder. So I'm just holding my breath and hoping that the disturbance isn't too much to the rest of the class. Afterwards, I thought I'd have a smooth bike ride to work, but then I discovered my bike got a flat tire so I had to walk it to the station. Was slightly late for my shift, this time I didn't have to drive HC. Tbh, I was a little disapointed since I like driving HC surprising. It's more chill than mobility pickups where you're manuevering through crowds and I can literally just talk to myself in Sichuanese the whole time. Maybe next time I should play the Sichuanese podcast I've been listening to, _Words Misunderstood_. Listening to the podcast is like listening to my nonexistent Sichuanese older sister with more experience in an alternate reality. Although bc of genetics and stuff, if I did have a sister, she'd probably be around Mom's height right? Looking back, although I called yesterday a curveball, the night was more eventful. Gideon pulled through and picked me up from the station right around 20:30. 

Also I hope it's not weird that I'm not talking too much about spiritual stuff here bc while it is an important reality, I don't want to be serious all the time and sound like a broken record. Plus, it feels more appropriate to do so in actual writing in my physical journals, whether personal or DT.

Can u believe I used to like cities? I guess I thought there was more culture and stuff to do and everyone's busy and supposedly productive. Also how every square inch is utilized and there are skyscrapers you can look out of. Nowadays, I can't stand to look at bare concrete for any longer than I have to. Like come on, the HSS and AP&M buildings were probably cheap to build but they look so plain. Zero color. I mean, places like SF Chinatown or Seattle are cool to visit, but definitely can't see myself living in the city

Found that I enjoy eating at diners more than fast food restaurants bc of the comfortable feel and how food is actually cooked with care. Especially if it's during fall or winter. And I imagine diners in the Midwest during those seasons would feel even more cozy (Not just bc I was a customer in a diner on stage for the Gospel Skit btw). It's a lot easier to talk about certain stuff at a diner or restaurant than in a fast food place. Maybe bc of the time it takes for you to order, the food prep time, then sitting there and eating your food comes with the expectation that you'll be there for a bit so you have the time to talk. It's not just scarfing down food or ordering takeout and leaving. So in a funny way, I'm no longer as averse to paying tips for diner service since the atmosphere really cannot be replicated at home in your dorm/apt.

I jokingly said that I'd present a few volumes of my autobiography at the Freshman Retreat on Sat, but now that I'm thinking about it, I wouldn't mind writing an autobiography someday. As Benjamin Franklin says, "If you would not be forgotten, as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading, or do things worth writing." And it would have an added benefit of allowing for encapsulation of my life details in a way that isn't the corny celebrity who thinks they're much more important than they actually are. I could say something like: "If you want to know more about the significance of Lake Elizabeth as a place in my hometown Fremont, just read Ch. 7 of my autobiography" or "For a detailed discussion of the evolution of Paul's friends/friend groups over time, please refer to the Friendships section on pg. 93" (But since we're already here, it would go something like Anikate and Vishaul -> Rohan Sodha and Manomay Dixit -> group grows up until jr high, then disbands; notable friend: Rahul Sura -> high school loner years (frosh and soph): Jason Tisby, Armando, Edwardo Ferrer, Stanley Chow -> (jr and sr yr of HS) Wesley and Bradly Wei, Siraj Patel, Eric Liao, Rishab M, Mihir Joshi, Aidan P -> covid and growing up happens, in short, these dudes really changed in a not so good way -> Present day: main friends are Ed and Sebastian, church peers are closer than friends). In reading, what's really nice is your reader is able to find what's most relevant to them, so they can skip the boring parts and go to what interests them. Unlike in a lecture or video where you have to sit through boring parts or scrub through, if you're reading and there are nice sections or paragraphs, you can usually scan to see what's most important to you. If I wrote an autobiography, I could talk about some events in my life in much greater detail than I ever possibly could in a conversation bc ain't nobody got time to hear your whole life story and I wouldn't have the time to tell it in one go. With a book, someone can read it when they have the time and in a place they feel most comfortable.

**Oct 18, 2023**

Wow, last time I wrote here was last Thursday. That definitely wasn't because every single day of last week was something new and I barely got any consistent learning/studying in and was hardly in check with my own emotions and thoughts about my life. And both my sleep debt and hunger levels were looking like a nsin(x) with lim n->infinity since the peaks and troughs were so sharp. Never before had I had so little sleep and so little food, but soon after so much food and so much sleep that it feels like it's at or nearing maximum capcity.

_Les Miserables_ was the topic of last Friday's homegroup. (Aside: I included one of the songs ("I Dreamed A Dream") in my life album _Hyperbaric_ in the week before, not knowing that John, Ellen, and some of the staff would watch the broadway performance the following week). When I was younger, I would wonder why my dad was so into this musical and I kind of thought it was too outdated to be of much entertainment. But after seeing it again on Friday at Carnegie, I realized that not only is this a timeless classic with many ideas to think about along with Christian themes, but also the songs are awesome like the vocal range required and holding out the notes super long. I'd say this is the best musical of all, but my second fav is _Into The Woods_.

I don't know if I've said this before, but music is really great for setting the mood. And it communicates it w/o even using words. So listening to peaceful music makes me feel more calm even if I'm not even processing my thoughts on paper. Conversely, if the music is super intense and dramatic, I feel like I'm on the precipice of something way bigger and extravagent than myself that's going to happen. Even better if there's no words, just instrumental. Because tbh, words are kind of optional. If anything, with the questionable/deceitful messages in today's music, it's more of a distraction and hindrance to enjoying the music. At the root, it's about musical notes, chords, and keys. And I now follow the music, not the person who makes it.

(To Ed:) So lemme see if I got this right, if a female that you're romantically interested in starts slandering your close friend and a friendship that's been going for over a decade and went through elementary, jr high, hs, covid, and currently college, that's called "being edgy", but me joking that you're Walter White and might have terminal cancer after hearing you cough several times is called "being offensive"? Ok buddy, yeah that makes sense. I guess I see what we're working with here. Some people have scales with unequal weights (and it's all too obvious) and they're way too proud of it.

"The insolent utterly deride me, / but I do not turn away from your law." -Ps 119:51 ESV

Last night it was super close, but managed to debug PA2 around an hr before the 22:00 deadline. LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ I pounded my chest so hard after all the test cases passed bc this was a certified victory moment and then I ate Ryan's stir-fried mystery meat which wasn't bad but also I don't think I would eat if I wasn't starving. Also discovered that Reading assignments for M187a are actually due 23:00 not, 23:59. #ComeOnBruh

This will probably be the last paragraph I write. I'm super famished since I only had four bowls of rice krispies. Chewing a stick o' gum rn. The good thing about not having a lot of dead time between classes is that the packing is very efficient, but not so much for leaving time to think about life and process what I'm going through. Even more why we should strive to get up earlier to have that uninterrupted time to be alone. No ordinary person would message you at like 5 in the morning. I've also realized that a theme of this autumn is eating more at diners and getting breakfast. I like diners a lot, since the food is actually made with care. Ofc, we can't go TOO often bc it takes a chunk out of your wallet and it all adds up over time. So this weekend Sebastian and I are thinking we're gonna do a study hall and then get spicy booritos from Primos and then do a Goosebumps marathon. Last Sat we took a crazy spontaneous trip to Julian, CA when the original plan was just to do some Mission Trails volunteering and go to Brothers Family Diner. But that's for another time. Now I need to do my job as a student and actually learn stuff. See U on the flip side.

Well, you probably already know why it's been so long since I've updated (block schedules, hardly any time alone to myself). I mean, even on Sat, I barely got the chance to do a video recording session and think about life before I met up with Sebastian to get IHOP. It was delicious! Especially the super thick French toast, which is actually better than the pancakes imo. Also this guy Sebastian fr goes to bed early af so it's like for late night stuff, it's probably only Ed who's gonna be down for that. I mean, I'm not much of a night owl, but come on bruh, calling 9p late is a little ridiculous. Do you know how long it took for me to make the shift to thinking that 12a is the dead of night instead of early and only getting startled when I saw 2a or later??? And all those times I was playing PvZ or doing math 154 or 142b hw until almost 5a and then had to take naps throughout the day? Sleeping earlier has actually done a lot more for me than getting up earlier, since I know that's what people always suggest in a clichÃ© way, but how do u think you're able to get up earlier if not by retiring to bed sooner? Now, if your schedule is super wonky, then yes you might have to get up ridiculously early and it'll feel like smashing into a concrete wall but that will make you tired enough to fall asleep earlier the next night and voila, back on track assuming you keep that early bedtime.

First time using the wheelchair cart and I must say, it was quite an experience. I thought Pranav was kidding when he said I'd get frustrated by how slow it is, but the darn thing doesn't go any more than 12 mph so I'm like c'mon bruh. Also I had to get help starting the engine and didn't know which one was the new ADA cart. Also Pranav was providing assistance with tightening the straps but I don't think we got it to fully work. My passenger was not as crabby as I was made to believe initially. My shift is over in a minute, so I'll be leaving soon but before that, I'll say that I half considered FaceTime calling Ed in the last half hr but then re-considered bc it's way too likely to run overtime and also I'm not super keen on talking to somebody who thinks they have everything figured out when I barely even got a chance to check in with how I'm feeling you know?
