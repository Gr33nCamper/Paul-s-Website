Went biking for the first time since June. Forgot how fun it is.

Tested out bike rack mount, saw new places on campus and revisited my old bike route back home from FA21. I was only 19 back then... I got a bit emotional since it wasn't so long ago but at the same time it feels like that was so far in my past ü•π

Today's message was on reconciling personal relationships. You know who I wrote down for the part where they asked us to write down someone we have a problem with, right? (Hint: starts with B, ends with ryan) Some people don't make it any easier for others to love them. In fact, some people rub you the wrong way. It's okay. God's love gives us the power to love others even when we think they've done absolutely nothing to deserve even 1% of our love.

Went for a run to burn off stress, discovered some awesome new energizing rock songs.
Kimchi fried rice and scrambled egg was delicious! Carmel Mtn at night is quite nice.

Happy Birthday to my dear nephew Micah! üéÇ

Labor Day Coronado outing was fun but went by quick. Earlier in the day, went to campus. All the restrooms were closed üôÉ. See my journal entry for more details.

Found a cool spot under the tree at Matthews Quad, tried a spicy chicken wrap from BK and got a choc OREO shake. Under $10! The fire alarm went off for some reason. After getting back home, I spent some time in silence at the La Jolla Colony park wearing my sunglasses. It was super peaceful and I could hear owls hooting.

Tried Snooze AM Eatery for the first time! I didn't know it would take like 20 min to make though so I basically had no time to eat it and took it directly to M103B lec. Had it for lunch and I'm so glad I got the bacon special pancake bc otherwise it would have been WAY too sweet. I mean, I still had to drink so much water.

Back in the library. This time I didn't go overboard with YouTube in PC. Only watched the CK video I said I would watch and nothing more.

(**Comment on Sep 02 mention of what I was like when I was 19/20): Different time, valuable to remember, but I've learned to let go of the immature mindset of my younger self where I was so childish to the point of making my life solely about music and media and getting stuck in the past. And I was online so much that I let the views I got from there influence the way I lived, as if it was the unquestionable authority. 

I would spend so many hours online to feel something but I only felt empty afterwards and the guilt of not being productive was almost soul-crushing. It was a struggle to get going on homework and find motivation to study since I was so isolated. There was no one to turn to for help with stuff and I didn't feel comfortable asking and looking needy in front of people. 

Stuff like wanting to buy groceries and live in the city and cook and take the train and how da wahman is usually super overreactive and overprotective was from anime (Yuck, right?) Also I can't believe I used to think that everything I did would age well and I wouldn't change my opinions much as I grew up. But that's completely untrue. 

I used to be super into rap music. But now I find it incredibly second-rate and cringe since people mainly listen to it to look cool or fit in when the topics in rap songs are questionable at best and downright deplorable at worst. You don't even need to be Christian to think this. Also after listening to so much rap and being immersed in the online culture surrounding it on Twitter and IG it's just the corniest thing to me when people act like they're "too cool" for stuff and will ignore you or do this and that to gain followers or likes. Wow you're definitely not insecure about yourself. You're so original, there are definitely not like 500 other people doing the exact same thing (Just be yourself kids. Then you don't have to struggle about being original because you're original. Your background and life experience are not the same as other people's. Some areas might be more similar to others' to some degree, but impossible to be exactly the same). I used to be super into fashion and dressing to fit certain themes or "eras" of myself. Now it's just a matter of not wearing the same thing too often to the point of getting old, but I no longer do it to get praise from others. Also it's not really worth it to buy so many clothes if you don't even wear them that often. I used to value intelligence so much that I was careful to speak to only people who got into selective colleges or who I deemed sufficiently intelligent. Now I value humanity and people more since I became Christian, so even if you're the most intellectual guy I know, it's not a guarantee that I'm gonna have an awesome time talking to you. I realized that as much as I like stuff from math or chemistry or programming, that is simply not a dependable basis for talking with ordinary people. Of course, I would like the people I talk to have at least some common sense. You don't have to be a rocket scientist but come on man, please at least ask me questions that don't have super obvious answers. 

At some point, you have to grow up. And if you still act like you did when you were 19 when you're 21, that's kinda cringe. Bc news flash buddy: your whole life is not just about watching TV shows and playing video games and buying takeout and doing HW.

I used to think it was so unfair that I had to grow up and actually take on more responsibilities and how life went by so fast, instead of having more time to enjoy things and have more fun. I was scared to grow up last summer and didn't want to let go of stuff like comics, movies, superheroes, and going super in-depth with everything like I used to be able to do, whether it was albums, books, or learning anything in general. But now I've realized that I could not mature without the death of my old self. And by letting the thrill pass, I realized that there are many good things about being more mature, like not wasting time on things you know won't suit you, being more efficient, receiving more respect/legitimacy from others, etc. It's not to look like I'm too cool for stuff in an uptight way, but it's the recognition that certain activities are simply no longer fitting for someone of my age and not stubbornly protesting that I'm still young at heart and doing the same things I used to do. It would be quite delusional to hold that position, not admirable for being loyal or "real to the end" as I previously thought. It is not a virtue simply to be unwilling to change your position, only if you are unwilling to change your current good position for a worse one.

Last night's conversation with Ed told me that sometimes it's alright to take a break from people. I find it super boring to hear about another dude's romantic relationship because it's like, who cares you know? I didn't call you to hear about every little detail about Syndy. Although you might think that's the most interesting thing in the world, I have ZERO interest in any of that. And you wonder why I like talking to cameras and journals and personal websites more than people? Or maybe I just dislike talking to people who are in love because it's like nobody asked to know what's going on in your relationship. Personally, relationships are important but at the same time, I also find that what you do alone or your routine is not trivial either. You need both, but as of now, it's like there's not even that many people to talk to in SD bc a lot of people left. Guess that'll change in a few weeks.

The good thing is that this summer, I learned more independence and realized that communicating with God is more reliable than depending solely on the church because literally every other week or so someone else leaves. It's very volatile, so at that point, I'd rather just do some stuff on my own and think about life and talk to you guys about stuff that won't raise like 50 billion questions that I don't feel like answering since I hate having to give so much context to someone who doesn't even know me like that or doesn't care to hear. But it's different here. I can express fully what I think. And it's okay if the reader doesn't want to read all this. A future reader can just skip over this part if they're not that interested. Mainly, it's to get my thoughts down. My willingness to give context is roughly proportional to how often I see someone but I guess there's a drop off at some point and when I'm short on time then even if I know someone well, I won't feel like giving them my whole life story and stuff. Also you only realize certain things looking back when you get older and more mature that you won't recognize at the moment, even though it's so close to the present.

Fish stew was alright

Watched some stand-up comedy and learned about learning strategies

Alright, back to programming

I realized M103B is more aptly described as ring/field/galois theory than just modern or abstract algebra. Anyways, somebody fr walked out of the final in the first 20 min so either they knew everything or they knew nothing. Also most people left within an hour. I spent two hours just to be safe. Messed up on the power tower problem for sure though because I thought it was calculated top-down instead of from the ground up.

Happy 21 nayR! üéÇ

Everything got offset by Labor Day so today felt like Saturday 

I like SDSU's campus. It's nice to have a change of location. Today was quite humid though, almost felt like I stepped off the plane in Chengdu. Sichuan is more humid but this was not very comfortable either. Thankfully there was AC so it wasn't unbearable. But now I wonder how people did it back in the days before AC. Did they just dig underground? In fact, simply for that reason, I'd be less eager to visit the 1800s since that's way before AC.

A moment of silence

Ed was telling me there is some evidence to suggest that 9/11 may have been an inside job but either way the fault is on the US. Also how George W. Bush is the worst president ever bc of the Iraq war.

Too dang hot bruh. I'm not complaining if LR gets too cold in the winter. If it's only warm rn because it's poorly insulated, then it will be freezing once it gets cold. I handle slightly chilly better than uncomfortably warm. Last year it was the opposite and I don't know why. Thankfully this year there was no horrendous heat wave. Maybe it's my NorCal skin. Whoever thought of using engines to dump heat out instead of only to use toward work is awesome.
