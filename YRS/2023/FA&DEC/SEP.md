Went biking for the first time since June. Forgot how fun it is.

Tested out bike rack mount, saw new places on campus and revisited my old bike route back home from FA21. I was only 19 back then... I got a bit emotional since it wasn't so long ago but at the same time it feels like that was so far in my past ü•π

Today's message was on reconciling personal relationships. You know who I wrote down for the part where they asked us to write down someone we have a problem with, right? (Hint: starts with B, ends with ryan) Some people don't make it any easier for others to love them. In fact, some people rub you the wrong way. It's okay. God's love gives us the power to love others even when we think they've done absolutely nothing to deserve even 1% of our love.

Went for a run to burn off stress, discovered some awesome new energizing rock songs.
Kimchi fried rice and scrambled egg was delicious! Carmel Mtn at night is quite nice.

Found a cool spot under the tree at Matthews Quad, tried a spicy chicken wrap from BK and got a choc OREO shake. Under $10! The fire alarm went off for some reason. After getting back home, I spent some time in silence at the La Jolla Colony park wearing my sunglasses. It was super peaceful and I could hear owls hooting.

Tried Snooze AM Eatery for the first time! I didn't know it would take like 20 min to make though so I basically had no time to eat it and took it directly to M103B lec. Had it for lunch and I'm so glad I got the bacon special pancake bc otherwise it would have been WAY too sweet. I mean, I still had to drink so much water.

Back in the library. This time I didn't go overboard with YouTube in PC. Only watched the CK video I said I would watch and nothing more.

Fields of butterflies, reality escapes her"

(**Comment on Sep 02 mention of what I was like when I was 19/20): Different time, valuable to remember, but I've learned to let go of the immature mindset of my younger self where I was so childish to the point of making my life solely about music and media and getting stuck in the past. And I was online so much that I let the views I got from there influence the way I lived, as if it was the unquestionable authority. 

I would spend so many hours online to feel something but I only felt empty afterwards and the guilt of not being productive was almost soul-crushing. It was a struggle to get going on homework and find motivation to study since I was so isolated. There was no one to turn to for help with stuff and I didn't feel comfortable asking and looking needy in front of people. 

Stuff like wanting to buy groceries and live in the city and cook and take the train and how da wahman is usually super overreactive and overprotective was from anime (Yuck, right?) Also I can't believe I used to think that everything I did would age well and I wouldn't change my opinions much as I grew up. But that's completely untrue. 

I used to be super into rap music. But now I find it incredibly second-rate and cringe since people mainly listen to it to look cool or fit in when the topics in rap songs are questionable at best and downright deplorable at worst. You don't even need to be Christian to think this. Also after listening to so much rap and being immersed in the online culture surrounding it on Twitter and IG it's just the corniest thing to me when people act like they're "too cool" for stuff and will ignore you or do this and that to gain followers or likes. Wow you're definitely not insecure about yourself. You're so original, there are definitely not like 500 other people doing the exact same thing (Just be yourself kids. Then you don't have to struggle about being original because you're original. Your background and life experience are not the same as other people's. Some areas might be more similar to others' to some degree, but impossible to be exactly the same). I used to be super into fashion and dressing to fit certain themes or "eras" of myself. Now it's just a matter of not wearing the same thing too often to the point of getting old, but I no longer do it to get praise from others. Also it's not really worth it to buy so many clothes if you don't even wear them that often. I used to value intelligence so much that I was careful to speak to only people who got into selective colleges or who I deemed sufficiently intelligent. Now I value humanity and people more since I became Christian, so even if you're the most intellectual guy I know, it's not a guarantee that I'm gonna have an awesome time talking to you. I realized that as much as I like stuff from math or chemistry or programming, that is simply not a dependable basis for talking with ordinary people. Of course, I would like the people I talk to have at least some common sense. You don't have to be a rocket scientist but come on man, please at least ask me questions that don't have super obvious answers. 

At some point, you have to grow up. And if you still act like you did when you were 19 when you're 21, that's kinda cringe. Bc news flash buddy: your whole life is not just about watching TV shows and playing video games and buying takeout and doing HW.

I used to think it was so unfair that I had to grow up and actually take on more responsibilities and how life went by so fast, instead of having more time to enjoy things and have more fun. I was scared to grow up last summer and didn't want to let go of stuff like comics, movies, superheroes, and going super in-depth with everything like I used to be able to do, whether it was albums, books, or learning anything in general. But now I've realized that I could not mature without the death of my old self. And by letting the thrill pass, I realized that there are many good things about being more mature, like not wasting time on things you know won't suit you, being more efficient, receiving more respect/legitimacy from others, etc. It's not to look like I'm too cool for stuff in an uptight way, but it's the recognition that certain activities are simply no longer fitting for someone of my age and not stubbornly protesting that I'm still young at heart and doing the same things I used to do. It would be quite delusional to hold that position, not admirable for being loyal or "real to the end" as I previously thought. It is not a virtue simply to be unwilling to change your position, only if you are unwilling to change your current good position for a worse one.
