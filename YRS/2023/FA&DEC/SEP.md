MY FAV SEASON IS HERE!!!!! üçÅ

Edit: So apparently Sep 23 is the Autumnal Equinox so it's technically still summer...cmon bruh

Had to finish some M103B HW at Syracuse

**Sep 02, 2023:**

Went biking for the first time since June. Forgot how fun it is.

Tested out bike rack mount, saw new places on campus and revisited my old bike route back home from FA21. I was only 19 back then... I got a bit emotional since it wasn't so long ago but at the same time it feels like that was so far in my past ü•π

Today's message was on reconciling personal relationships. You know who I wrote down for the part where they asked us to write down someone we have a problem with, right? (Hint: starts with B, ends with ryan) Some people don't make it any easier for others to love them. In fact, some people rub you the wrong way. It's okay. God's love gives us the power to love others even when we think they've done absolutely nothing to deserve even 1% of our love.

Went for a run to burn off stress, discovered some awesome new energizing rock songs.
Kimchi fried rice and scrambled egg was delicious! Carmel Mtn at night is quite nice.

Happy Birthday to my dear nephew Micah! üéÇ

Labor Day Coronado outing was fun but went by quick. Earlier in the day, went to campus. All the restrooms were closed üôÉ. See my journal entry for more details.

Found a cool spot under the tree at Matthews Quad, tried a spicy chicken wrap from BK and got a choc OREO shake. Under $10! The fire alarm went off for some reason. After getting back home, I spent some time in silence at the La Jolla Colony park wearing my sunglasses. It was super peaceful and I could hear owls hooting.

**Sep 06, 2023:**

Tried Snooze AM Eatery for the first time! I didn't know it would take like 20 min to make though so I basically had no time to eat it and took it directly to M103B lec. Had it for lunch and I'm so glad I got the bacon special pancake bc otherwise it would have been WAY too sweet. I mean, I still had to drink so much water.

Back in the library. This time I didn't go overboard with YouTube in PC. Only watched the CK video I said I would watch and nothing more.

(**Comment on Sep 02 mention of what I was like when I was 19/20): Different time, valuable to remember, but I've learned to let go of the immature mindset of my younger self where I was so childish to the point of making my life solely about music and media and getting stuck in the past. And I was online so much that I let the views I got from there influence the way I lived, as if it was the unquestionable authority. 

I would spend so many hours online to feel something but I only felt empty afterwards and the guilt of not being productive was almost soul-crushing. It was a struggle to get going on homework and find motivation to study since I was so isolated. There was no one to turn to for help with stuff and I didn't feel comfortable asking and looking needy in front of people. 

Stuff like wanting to buy groceries and live in the city and cook and take the train and how da wahman is usually super overreactive and overprotective was from anime (Yuck, right?) Also I can't believe I used to think that everything I did would age well and I wouldn't change my opinions much as I grew up. But that's completely untrue. 

I used to be super into rap music. But now I find it incredibly second-rate and cringe since people mainly listen to it to look cool or fit in when the topics in rap songs are questionable at best and downright deplorable at worst. You don't even need to be Christian to think this. Also after listening to so much rap and being immersed in the online culture surrounding it on Twitter and IG it's just the corniest thing to me when people act like they're "too cool" for stuff and will ignore you or do this and that to gain followers or likes. Wow you're definitely not insecure about yourself. You're so original, there are definitely not like 500 other people doing the exact same thing (Just be yourself kids. Then you don't have to struggle about being original because you're original. Your background and life experience are not the same as other people's. Some areas might be more similar to others' to some degree, but impossible to be exactly the same). I used to be super into fashion and dressing to fit certain themes or "eras" of myself. Now it's just a matter of not wearing the same thing too often to the point of getting old, but I no longer do it to get praise from others. Also it's not really worth it to buy so many clothes if you don't even wear them that often. I used to value intelligence so much that I was careful to speak to only people who got into selective colleges or who I deemed sufficiently intelligent. Now I value humanity and people more since I became Christian, so even if you're the most intellectual guy I know, it's not a guarantee that I'm gonna have an awesome time talking to you. I realized that as much as I like stuff from math or chemistry or programming, that is simply not a dependable basis for talking with ordinary people. Of course, I would like the people I talk to have at least some common sense. You don't have to be a rocket scientist but come on man, please at least ask me questions that don't have super obvious answers. 

At some point, you have to grow up. And if you still act like you did when you were 19 when you're 21, that's kinda cringe. Bc news flash buddy: your whole life is not just about watching TV shows and playing video games and buying takeout and doing HW.

I used to think it was so unfair that I had to grow up and actually take on more responsibilities and how life went by so fast, instead of having more time to enjoy things and have more fun. I was scared to grow up last summer and didn't want to let go of stuff like comics, movies, superheroes, and going super in-depth with everything like I used to be able to do, whether it was albums, books, or learning anything in general. But now I've realized that I could not mature without the death of my old self. And by letting the thrill pass, I realized that there are many good things about being more mature, like not wasting time on things you know won't suit you, being more efficient, receiving more respect/legitimacy from others, etc. It's not to look like I'm too cool for stuff in an uptight way, but it's the recognition that certain activities are simply no longer fitting for someone of my age and not stubbornly protesting that I'm still young at heart and doing the same things I used to do. It would be quite delusional to hold that position, not admirable for being loyal or "real to the end" as I previously thought. It is not a virtue simply to be unwilling to change your position, only if you are unwilling to change your current good position for a worse one.

**Sep 07, 2023:**

Last night's conversation with Ed told me that sometimes it's alright to take a break from people. I find it super boring to hear about another dude's romantic relationship because it's like, who cares you know? I didn't call you to hear about every little detail about Syndy. Although you might think that's the most interesting thing in the world, I have ZERO interest in any of that. And you wonder why I like talking to cameras and journals and personal websites more than people? Or maybe I just dislike talking to people who are in love because it's like nobody asked to know what's going on in your relationship. Personally, relationships are important but at the same time, I also find that what you do alone or your routine is not trivial either. You need both, but as of now, it's like there's not even that many people to talk to in SD bc a lot of people left. Guess that'll change in a few weeks.

The good thing is that this summer, I learned more independence and realized that communicating with God is more reliable than depending solely on the church because literally every other week or so someone else leaves. It's very volatile, so at that point, I'd rather just do some stuff on my own and think about life and talk to you guys about stuff that won't raise like 50 billion questions that I don't feel like answering since I hate having to give so much context to someone who doesn't even know me like that or doesn't care to hear. But it's different here. I can express fully what I think. And it's okay if the reader doesn't want to read all this. A future reader can just skip over this part if they're not that interested. Mainly, it's to get my thoughts down. My willingness to give context is roughly proportional to how often I see someone but I guess there's a drop off at some point and when I'm short on time then even if I know someone well, I won't feel like giving them my whole life story and stuff. Also you only realize certain things looking back when you get older and more mature that you won't recognize at the moment, even though it's so close to the present.

Fish stew was alright

Watched some stand-up comedy and learned about learning strategies

Alright, back to programming

I realized M103B is more aptly described as ring/field/galois theory than just modern or abstract algebra. Anyways, somebody fr walked out of the final in the first 20 min so either they knew everything or they knew nothing. Also most people left within an hour. I spent two hours just to be safe. Messed up on the power tower problem for sure though because I thought it was calculated top-down instead of from the ground up. 

&nbsp;

Happy 21 nayR! üéÇ

Everything got offset by Labor Day so today felt like Saturday 

I like SDSU's campus. It's nice to have a change of location. Today was quite humid though, almost felt like I stepped off the plane in Chengdu. Sichuan is more humid but this was not very comfortable either. Thankfully there was AC so it wasn't unbearable. But now I wonder how people did it back in the days before AC. Did they just dig underground? In fact, simply for that reason, I'd be less eager to visit the 1800s since that's way before AC.

[......]

A moment of silence

Ed was telling me there is some evidence to suggest that 9/11 may have been an inside job but either way the fault is on the US. Also how George W. Bush is the worst president ever bc of the Iraq war.

Too dang hot bruh. I'm not complaining if LR gets too cold in the winter. If it's only warm rn because it's poorly insulated, then it will be freezing once it gets cold. I handle slightly chilly better than uncomfortably warm. Last year it was the opposite and I don't know why. Thankfully this year there was no horrendous heat wave. Maybe it's my NorCal skin. Whoever thought of using engines to dump heat out instead of only to use toward work is awesome.

(JR YR RETURN FLIGHT)**

This guy Ed really didn't say nothing about the birthday wishes.. ok bruh

-

Went to Viewridge

Ate Korean food for lunch on Convoy

Did some apt cleaning

went to Encinatas to bike along the beach

Ate some leftover tomato egg stirfry for dinner

headed out for movie night with Sebastian

_Kindergarten Cop_ was quite funny and I like the 90s style, not just for the nice outfits but also the lack of super "woke" stuff like making everything about freedom of self-expression and "everyone's a winner" and stuff like that. The critic reviews say it's meh but come on bruh, I'm not from the 90s so for me it was entertaining for a movie night. I didn't need it to have an awesome shelf life to enjoy. I was there for lighthearted humor and didn't want to watch anything R-rated. It wasn't an in-depth film analysis bruh. Also the setting in Astoria, Oregon was quite nice because they have so many beautiful evergreen trees like fir, pine, and hemlock so one day I'd like to visit Oregon.

**Sep 14, 2023:**

Longest day

Woke up around 8:30 in the morning for the Bear Ridge trail hike, didn't go to bed until almost 6a the next day

Hike was awesome and it was good to have Ahmed there to liven up conversation (compared to if it was only Sebastian and I) and also clarify what we believe as Christians. Visited this place called Bates Nut Farm and I was loving the whole atmosphere since fall is approaching so the pumpkin patch and autumn-themed wares in the store were super awesome. Fall is my fav season and I think we're gonna have to come back in the fall.

Ate at Fat Ivor's Rib Rack, super stuffed. Our waitress was named Kat, and she was really nice. She was telling us about how Valley Center is "country" but not as much as before since there's been new housing development and also how there's not many attractions besides the Bates Nut Farm. Many people will just go to other nearby cities with more stuff to do (But if you ask me, it looks quite beautiful so I enjoyed hiking out there and seeing more trees) She said there's only one high school for the whole town so everyone knows who's around their age. She majored in history and graduated like 10 years ago so she was in her early 30s.

Got some Salt & Straw ice cream afterward. I picked the fall exclusive flavors: Pumpkin Spiced Tiramisu and the Beecher‚Äôs Cheese w/ Apple Pie Cinnamon Rolls scoops

Ahmed dropped me off at LR and I took a quick shower

Bros potluck began shortly after and we made "communist" fried rice since everyone contributed something to the one dish. Started off kinda slow but later on we loosened up and it got more energetic. I left shortly after dinner to help Trip move some stuff from Enders but it was pretty quick, in and out within an hour. Got back in time to watch some Ip-man. I know I watched it back in high school, but this time around I think I was more engaged with the story and since it's my culture and I can understand what the northern guy was saying, there was more personal significance. Seeing how China was like during WWII when Japan invaded, I can see why some older folks from China dislike the Japanese and it's crazy how they went from military power to super peaceful today like whoa what happened? I'm glad they've changed but at the same time, it's still disappointing that some people are so willing to write off Japan's past grievances in the war just bc they like the cool tech and infrastructure and anime of modern Japan. Forgive, but we shouldn't forget history, since that explains the state of the world today. Similarly, we shouldn't forget our pasts since that explains things about us today. I think it's valuable to reflect on our pasts, but we shouldn't get stuck in the past bc that makes your current life stale and you can't move forward. We can only live in the present, the past cannot be re-lived, only remembered

Got up after 12 bc of last night's antics

Swept away by a BiliBili tangent (I've deleted the app) and barely finished DT

Long day pt 3

Didn't get more than 5 hr 20 min of sleep, but I didn't have a sip of joe

Carpool with the Moores

Prayer walk 8:30a and then we didn't end until like 11p

SET retreat was no joke, dozed off multiple times in the second session. Chewed so much gum that my jaw hurt.

Visited Miramar ceremony, felt somber but also it was quite inspiring.

Played some ping pong and had an ice cream cookie sandwich.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Sep 17, 2023:**

Sorta long day

Hibernated 11 hrs, got decent rest

drove to SWS with Tobi and Steve, did a short tour for SDSU then went to VR for the final SET retreat session

Now it's just like I need some alone time to recharge so I'll get up earlier tmrw since sleep doesn't count as alone time and when else will I get that recharge time? Might lose my sanity and patience if I don't do that. I just wanna sit in the park in silence and listen to birds. Also maybe listen to some music. I took that for granted when I was still in SS2. Been at VR so much the past few days. Might lose my sanity if I'm there any longer than I have to because even though it's nice, it's also much smaller than Geisel so it's very easy to lose your sanity if you're there too long. And the ceiling is quite low. At least it isn't stuffy. In fact, it gets a bit chilly.

Shoot, just remembered we're actually going to La Mesa college to do outreach tmrw. How fun!!

&nbsp;

**Sep 20, 2023:**

First day of rest since last week. 

Stats/probability tutoring didn't take too long, and there was also breakfast provided so I was like aw heck yeah that's super nice! And the prep book didn't ask about super advanced stuff like Bayes' Theorem and Binomial, poisson, geometric, exponential, etc distributions and random variables and variances or proving any of the theorems or propositions such as P(A^c) = 1 - P(A). The concepts were pretty simple so like how P(A ‚à™ B) = P(A) + P(B) <=> A and B are mutually exclusive but if there's some overlap, then you have to use P(A ‚à™ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ‚à© B) so you don't double count.

After walking in the park, I spent some time in the library. Did DT, prayed, and learned about Chinese culture.
Enjoyed learning more about the Sichuanese language (my culture) from YouTube and stuff but at the same time, there's not a lot of longform content on Bili Bili in general, even on the website and some stuff is poorly dubbed so I wish I could just talk to people on the street or listen to some Sichuanese podcasts.

&nbsp; 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Sep 21, 2023:**

Woken up by the sounds of powerwashing

Beautiful scenery in Rose canyon and some trees are even changing color

Kimchi pasta was delicious, also got a lot of food after practice like somi somi, vallarta's fries, and 85¬∫C

Final day of skit practice. We all improved a lot since day 1. I like that I only have a minor role to play because there aren't too many lines to memorize and also it relieves some pressure for a starting role. I'd rather not be in the limelight, since the focus is on the gospel message and also it's kind of awkward to talk to people after the performance when you were a major character. Or maybe I'm overthinking it and all you have to do is act natural and not bring up the performance at all, since it's already self-evident you acted. I don't have to go dead silent, just talk about other stuff.

AUTUMNAL EQUINOX üçÅ

Sebastian and I volunteered at Mission Trails. Ranger Julie was quite encouraging. Checked out the station and went to praise practice in the evening. Josh Yang returned and sent me home from VR. Stayed up super late playing Desert Survival board game but it was fun to work together towards a common goal instead of getting super angry when some guy pulls a d move on you or something.

&nbsp; 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Sep 24, 2023:**

First SWS of the year. Some people returned. New faces. Seniors shared about their first week of college. This feels unreal even though I'm living it. It's all going by so quickly. Later in the day it was sports. TJ and I got swept in spikeball by this dude named Albert. It's hard reaching out to groups of guys because you have to be like "Hi what's your name?" to like 5 guys in succession and you already know you're probably not gonna remember any of their names after that.

&nbsp; 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Sep 25, 2023:**

McDonald's in the evenings is becoming a pattern. Last night some random guy was cursing up a storm and it was painfully awkward sitting through the whole thing.

Might need to spend time alone reflecting on whether I'm serving with the proper heart posture and also highkey thinking I might crack under the responsibility of being a senior if I don't pray for help about this. Like I'm just super worried about getting called out for something since I doubt my abilities too much and don't think I can contribute anything of value to a conversation when there's already a bunch of other older folks talking. But maybe I need to act as if I'm not afraid of rejection to be a better leader. Or just agree with criticism for fun and see if it actually goes away as Richard Carlson claims. Maybe I'm just acting too stiff and need to loosen up. I know Welcome Week is serious but you don't have to be somber the whole time. These journaling opportunities are much more precious when there's actual emotions I need to express and stuff on my mind. I mean, the casual stuff is cool, but really the primary purpose is not meant for just recording data and what happened. I mean, sometimes it's important. Some items or numbers have a special significance. Like 23 since it's 2023 or 20 since that's the day I was born. To be honest though, 2 is my favorite prime number since it's the smallest one. But I like 1 a lot also since it's the universal divisor. My fav real number is œÄ though. I like cosine better than sine.

But as I was saying, it's not as helpful for myself when it's just recording regular stuff like having meals or going places. I mean, that's cool but what's more valuable is recording my thoughts and emotions. So stuff like feeling out of place at the In N Out social because everyone else seems to be talking and then I'm alone but I'm still super reluctant to approach new people unless they're alone and I have an irrational fear that I'm gonna get the heck roasted out of me. You know what? Forget all that, I already told myself I wanted to embrace awkwardness as long as it's for getting to know people. Why am I still so scared? Also the topic was brought up about how I don't talk that often and then I said how much I talk is heavily dependent on what we're talking about. I should have just been super honest and said I like talking about stuff like 19th century history and American literature during that time. And if it's during the school year, math and science more just to keep it in my mind and since that was what we did in high school. I used to be much more of a nerd about this stuff and bring it into casual conversation but now it's just weird like it's my job but I'm not always in work mode you know. Oh! I just remembered something else I like talking about: nature and animals. Also trees and fall colors. I like all things natural actually. There's certainly a connection between certain cultures and the land and flora/fauna found there. For example, my parents are from Sichuan and pandas are native to that region of China so they are special to me. And I like to think about deeper topics and ponder things about life like how time is not like money bc we can never get more than what we have. It's also fun to talk about memes or stuff back in the day like the grilled cheese sandwiches in a bag for lunch and blasting tanks in TO in jr high feeling like I was a real war vet in Europe, walking back home from school and smelling Indian food cooking. I like calculus a lot still, especially integrals and infinite series and Taylor polynomials. Polar and spherical coordinates are also cool bc of how useful they are for dealing with circles or spheres. Tbh I don't really like the distance formula in Cartesian and prefer dealing with angles instead of x and y displacements. Programming is pretty fun, albeit frustrating when the program isn't doing what you want it to and you spend super long trying to figure out what's bugging it. Fables and ancient wisdom also catch my fancy since I find it much more illustrative to hear a story with a lesson instead of just being told the lesson. Vocabulary actually undergirds a lot of my humor and personality since I tend to use words or phrases that aren't ordinarily used such as rascality, skedaddle, "My wig!", you scoundrel!, confound it!, and I'll sometimes do what I like to call precision politeness mode where I'll talk in very brief phrases and smile a lot more. It reminds me of firing well-aimed railgun shots around walls in TO. But then there's also my well-known catchphrases which change with the season. Some I currently use include: "Aw cmon bruh", "For REAL", "It's time to get serious", "Oh so you're gonna play like THAT?", "It's wonderfully cool", "I'm absolutely famished!", "Yeah right!", "What the heck?", "SIT DOWN SON".

Ok that's all for now.

**Sep 26, 2023:**

I ended up painting a tote bag based on the fall foliage pic I took in Indiana last Oct and people were saying it looked like a Bob Ross painting. I was a little bit embarassed since I didn't expect to get spotlighted and like it so much. Shout out to elementary school art classes at Soho and with Wang laoshi.

We ended WAG activities a bit earlier than usual. Alex drove Ahmed and I back home, took a side quest to get some gas. Gas prices are rising again. I asked Alex about what it's like as a postgrad and apparently there's a membership training but that hasn't happened yet and how the planning meetings are super in-depth. When I confided that I was fearful of the younger ones retaliating and being like "Who the freak are you to tell me what to do???" he said that wouldn't happen bc we respect older ones in the church. So even if someone from c/o 22 asked him to do something, he would do it.

**Sep 27, 2023:**

7 hrs is the most sleep I've gotten during welcome week. All the rest were like 5 hrs.

Flyering is what I'm most comfortable with, even though the walk-bys and rejections initially hurt. It's like after a while, you get over it. Or maybe it's that the message is so important that you're willing to get rejected. Also helps that we get to flyer and table together bc it would be much harder to do this solo.

First day working as Triton Transit Mobility driver. Met a guy named Sam and he was showing me the HC route. Pretty funny guy, sophomore from Long Beach. We were talking about the almost full moon that night. I think I'm gonna enjoy my job. Standing up for 5 hrs and working retail? Sorry man, not my thing. And let's be real, who goes to the bookstore for books? There's literally a library!

Rained this morning but then got super sunny so I kind of went overkill with the Columbia rainjacket. Wore it on my walk back home in the evening after my shift though, bc it was a bit chilly and the AC was on full blast in McDonald's.

NO RESERVES.
NO RETREAT.
NO REGRETS.

Earliest I've woken up since Seattle. Not feeling too tired rn and last night's McDonald's was quite a lot so I don't think I need food until maybe lunch. Might need a cup of joe around then also so that its effect lasts through the most important times: the afternoon when there's lecture and also the rest of the day's outreach
