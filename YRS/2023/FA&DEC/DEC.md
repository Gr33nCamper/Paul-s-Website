This might be the last McBreakfast of the year. I know I haven't written here in a while guys relax. The past week has been a blur of events. Friday was sports night and Andrew's birthday, Saturday was doing final prelabs and going to Mira Mesa library and visiting University Heights library and seeing UCSD Medical Center, Sunday was my testimony (which people seemed to like), Monday was Chem108 lab practical and yesterday was the Chem142 final presentation which was not that bad. Public speaking is not as stressful as something like just striking up a conversation since you have the floor and don't really have to worry about responding to the other person. Maybe that's just me though.

Suffering unjustly is not fun, but that is what we are called to join in. And to trust that God will judge justly and maintain the cause of the afflicted. Remember the verse in Psalms that says something like how the wicked constantly assail me? I'm feeling that more. But the sheep does not know what's best for it, the Shepherd does. My father in heaven will not allow the wicked to prevail. Also as it says in our 1 Peter DT, there's no benefit in enduring suffering for your sin, since that's exactly what you deserve.

Guess who's going to the Deep South next week? Ya brother and Sebastian will be driving to Louisiana over the break and hopefully we'll see some nice swamps and trees. Plan so far is San Diego, CA -> Tucson, AZ -> Fredericksburg, TX -> Lake Charles, LA.

Fall quarter is over in one week. Gotta knock out these two postlabs. IT'S TOO EASY okay maybe not the initial act of starting it, but once I get started it's a wrap. Don't relax just yet. We don't need a repeat of the Thanksgiving break last two days postlab industrial revolution work shifts.

Classical music might be the purest representation of emotion, free from any messages or associations with man-made things. Like the chill beats I listen to are nice and all but they're often linked to other images, which aren't always natural (e.g. "Beef" beat sounding like something you'd hear in a casino lounge late at night, "Hell Shell" beat makes me think of a haunted carnival / walking into a cathedral on a cold October evening / 90s digital era of the box computers, walkmans, and arcades). Another thing is I enjoy listening to music to resonate with emotions and images without lyrics more than I used to. I remember going to a SF symphony performance when I was younger and being super bored since there were no pictures. Now, I think I'd be on the edge of my seat hearing it. As long as the pieces are unique since I find those more entertaining than the classics, at least as of now.

Yesterday as I was sitting in Geisel 7th floor looking at the fog outside and listening to classical music, I suddenly got an image of me as a painter holding an easel and canvas and wearing a beret and a button up shirt and coat. Something Victorian in style, that people might have worn in England or France. Another thing I can see myself wearing is a tailcoat plus a top hat and cane, kind of like Willy Wonka. As for long coats with the belts, those look cool but are a bit expensive and when would I wear them?
