This might be the last McBreakfast of the year. I know I haven't written here in a while guys relax. The past week has been a blur of events. Friday was sports night and Andrew's birthday, Saturday was doing final prelabs and going to Mira Mesa library and visiting University Heights library and seeing UCSD Medical Center, Sunday was my testimony (which people seemed to like), Monday was Chem108 lab practical and yesterday was the Chem142 final presentation which was not that bad. Public speaking is not as stressful as something like just striking up a conversation since you have the floor and don't really have to worry about responding to the other person. Maybe that's just me though.

Suffering unjustly is not fun, but that is what we are called to join in. And to trust that God will judge justly and maintain the cause of the afflicted. Remember the verse in Psalms that says something like how the wicked constantly assail me? I'm feeling that more. But the sheep does not know what's best for it, the Shepherd does. My father in heaven will not allow the wicked to prevail. Also as it says in our 1 Peter DT, there's no benefit in enduring suffering for your sin, since that's exactly what you deserve.

Guess who's going to the Deep South next week? Ya brother and Sebastian will be driving to Louisiana over the break and hopefully we'll see some nice swamps and trees. Plan so far is San Diego, CA -> Tucson, AZ -> Fredericksburg, TX -> Lake Charles, LA.

Fall quarter is over in one week. Gotta knock out these two postlabs. IT'S TOO EASY okay maybe not the initial act of starting it, but once I get started it's a wrap. Don't relax just yet. We don't need a repeat of the Thanksgiving break last two days postlab industrial revolution work shifts.

Classical music might be the purest representation of emotion, free from any messages or associations with man-made things. Like the chill beats I listen to are nice and all but they're often linked to other images, which aren't always natural (e.g. "Beef" beat sounding like something you'd hear in a casino lounge late at night, "Hell Shell" beat makes me think of a haunted carnival / walking into a cathedral on a cold October evening / 90s digital era of the box computers, walkmans, and arcades). Another thing is I enjoy listening to music to resonate with emotions and images without lyrics more than I used to. I remember going to a SF symphony performance when I was younger and being super bored since there were no pictures. Now, I think I'd be on the edge of my seat hearing it. As long as the pieces are unique since I find those more entertaining than the classics, at least as of now.

Yesterday as I was sitting in Geisel 7th floor looking at the fog outside and listening to classical music, I suddenly got an image of me as a painter holding an easel and canvas and wearing a beret and a button up shirt and coat. Something Victorian in style, that people might have worn in England or France. Another thing I can see myself wearing is a tailcoat plus a top hat and cane, kind of like Willy Wonka. As for long coats with the belts, those look cool but are a bit expensive and when would I wear them?

AZ. TMR. FINISH FINAL.

Listening to some chill instrumental beats and jotting some thoughts down. Thought about going to the park, but I gotta finish the cs100 practice final and final. Also I've been finding it more comfortable to work from home towards the end of the quarter. The thing about Geisel is, it's a little too quiet sometimes and I don't really get to personalize the space. Another thing is I've kind of not liked being outside where too many people know me because it's like u guys are my fam but I need some time alone too. I'm more drawn to things that are peaceful as heck instead of super intense. That's shown in my music playlists, clothing, and well I guess it's a philosophy from Richard Carlson. Slowed and reverb is not it for movement, it's better for late night contemplation. I was listening to the Broke Boi slowed instrumental and it didn't fit the writing mood.

This quarter blazed by. Lately, I've been feeling like I don't know what to feel. It's the first quarter I've actually enjoyed in a while instead of feeling like it's just pain on pain. People I've gotten to know and spend time with, stuff I do outside of class like going on hikes, walks, or diners, a super fun job that doesn't involve handling customer complaints, my favorite season of the year with the trees and cold weather, trips throughout the quarter (Julian daytrip, Riverside weekend, Thanksgiving holiday).

CSE100 FINAL COMPLETE. WE OUT. 

Okay there's still work, last two shifts of the year. I'm on like 4 hrs of sleep though. It was super hot last night. Haven't even packed yet. But can you believe it? Also YouTube got super old. I just don't feel like watching anything anymore. Or playing Tanki. All I had this afternoon was a banana, a biscuit with honey, a mug of milk, and a slice of pepperoni pizza. I need sleep. Everything is jarringly bright. Ok this is better. I just put on the orange cap and shades.

Good evening. Just wanted to say that sometimes you need a break from people and that's okay. My church fam is important and all, but sometimes there's so much pressure to keep doing stuff that it feels suffocating. But it shouldn't feel like a chore right? I don't know, personally, I just wanted some peace and quiet w/o apartment mates asking me idiotic questions. Bc that's exactly why I don't like staying in the apartment with them for too long. Ok, if it's just Gideon and I, it's not that bad. Ryan and I isn't awful either. But for Bryan, it's like... ooh you're really lucky we live together and that God is our maker for otherwise I would REALLY let you have it. 

Taking a break shouldn't be seen as ditching the tribe. I think taking personal time to reflect is important. Traveling is really good for resetting and expanding your view of the world. Actually, anything that takes you outside your bubble (aka comfort zone) is pretty good. Also with that many people, you really think everybody is gonna be super close with each other? And you seriously don't think some people drive each other nuts after a while? For me, it was mounting pressure I felt to be good and set an example right. I have high expectations for how I should be like especially in front of others and my reputation but that shouldn't come in front of being a genuine person and valuing relationships right? Idk, after the testimony I kinda just wanted to hide away bc I don't really like to talk to people afterwards about the presentation/performance.

CoryxKenshin got old btw. I'm done with gaming videos. I'd rather see stuff from real life. Recently I like ones where people do imitations of real life situations like types of people or midwest life or different cultures but not sus. Okay, I did walk close to the edge of the cliff today. But don't worry, I stepped back to the guardrail because I knew what was gonna happen. 9 times out of 10 you fall if you try to balance on the edge. Not always, but your own willpower is only so strong and luck is not always on your side. It's like the story of Samson the judge and how he kept living life dangerously, as if there was a reset button on life. He had a lot of potential, being both strong and intelligent, but it was ultimately wasted on cheap thrills and pleasures. I don't know where I'm going with this. I guess I'm trying to say that we can't exactly trust our sheep instinct and especially since I'm a young man, I need a lot of self-control. But that's what God's commands are for.

Back from Reno safely. Talked with Jack and got to an understanding of how I can better manage my anger. I thought Trip was gonna chew me out for not praying for the freshman guys, and then I started reflecting on how I feel like I've been neglecting my relationship with God and haven't rooted myself in His Word which is why I feel like I didn't see the purpose of what I was doing in FA23 and got a bit irritated. It got to the point where it felt like I was being expected to do so much w/o attending to my own need to be alone and reflect. But that's why I like being back at home. Sometimes you don't feel like dealing with apartment mates and want to be in your childhood home where you can really reflect on your past, without people from your past popping up. Since, you know, basically all the people from high school you moved on from and even old friends who were not real ones. So you can just focus on being alone and thinking with yourself, since you know yourself better than outside observers.
