_The Fame_ by Lady Gaga goes hard bruh 

I feel like this year I've been more open to music genres and vibes other than rap and hip hop whether that's indie pop, disco, country, rock, metal, Latin, opera, 90s R&B, soul, medieval music, hyperpop, phonk, house music, etc

After watching Anime House finale by RDCworld1, I'm curious about One Piece, Death Note, and Yu Yu Hakusho. Well, I was thinking about entering a pirate arc but now I'm thinking Death Note captures my interest more

Glad I went out for a solo run today, it was quite beautiful outside and felt more alive breathing in the fresh air and getting sun. Also it was fun to skip tracks that didn't fit the mood, like nah I'm not feeling this one let's swap it out. Like you're not forced to sit through a song that doesn't go with running, you're not obligated to give your time to listen to that song it's a free market economy if you like it, then listen if you don't feel like listening, don't force yourself to listen to it just to appear like a loyal fan. Like even though I liked Tyler, The Creator a lot back in high school, I don't really listen to his music all that much these days, people's tastes change over time and it's ok

Well, everyone except Siraj is free on Wednesday evening. And after the upcoming Friday, Rishab will be in Florida.

As for me, the week of 12/25 - 12/31, I'll only be free 12/26 and 12/27. Since 12/28 is when we're leaving for the ski trip

Either way it goes, some of us won't be able to make it. Just comes to show how early you have to plan something for even the most remote chance of it happening and also how much more difficult it is to get your friends together after you all graduated
