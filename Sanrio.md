Getting up before 11a is so new to me it's like wow the sun actually exists

--- 

I just know i got absolutely ReKT on the Math 140A midterm ü´†

Gotta get some more practice using the definitions/theorems/lemmas/corollaries. 

Also I took a look at Cantor's Diagonalization argument on YouTube and I'm like hold on a min... I see what the goal is!

To prove that the set of all real numbers is uncountable:

Let A be the set of all real numbers and E be a subset of A (the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1 with only 3 and 4 as digits).  

Assume for the sake of contradiction that E is countably infinite, so it can be written as the set of all such numbers e_1, e_2, e_3, ...., e_n

We make a number e that differs from every number in E in at least one decimal position in this manner: 

if the nth digit of the nth number is a 3, change it to a 4. Vice versa if digit is 4.

So we see that {e_1, e_2, ... , e_n},  

(the countably infinite set containing all the numbers in E)

doesn't actually contain one number that is different from the rest and also belongs to E. 

Since we made the number an arbitrary sequence of digits this means no matter what, that subset will not contain one such number.

Thus, there is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that E is a countable set must have been false. 

&nbsp; 

Now, since E is a subset of A and clearly doesn't contain all of A's elements, it is smaller.

If E, the smaller subset of the larger set, is already uncountable 

then we can reasonably conclude that the larger set must also be uncountable
