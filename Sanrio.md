purchased Gloom Shroom from Crazy Dave's shop

tested out the garlic and row of marigolds strategy

might need to modify that for getting the 8k sun achievement one day

Went to H-Mart for dinner and enjoyed a Pork cutlet combo meal just before the place closed

Got ingredients for mashed potatoes (which will be served at the Juniors welcome back potluck)

Brian came by to drop off an OLED switch.

*Ahem* * *Ahem* * BRIAN CAME BY TO DROP OFF AN OLED SWITCH

BRIAN CAME BY TO DROP OFF‚Äî Ok ok, I think you get the idea

Nah, but actually he kind of the goat for that you know 

He really didn't have to 

Really

But he did 

And I'm saying we should host him over sometime for a special meal

2MANY (Taking My Swag) leaked after a group buy for like $8K.

IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

Super unique beat from Richie Souf. Sounds kinda like jumping and there's these short digital beep sounding flares that start soft but then get louder and cut off  

Apparently this was recorded in Oct 2019 

WATCHU KNOW ABOUT DAT BABY VOICE CARTI??
