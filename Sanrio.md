BACK IN SD! 4U! ALMOST NO SL33P, SO HAD TO SIP SOME COFFEE THIS MORNING ☕️

I'VE HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF CROWDED AIRPORTS TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. GLAD TO BE HOME.

Enjoyed some spontaneous Subarashi Poké and grocery shopping w/ Gideon and Bryan this evening. This time didn't soak the rice with sauce, only got Eel and the super spicy sauce which wasn't actually that spicy like not even a kick or nuthin. I'm starting to think Main Chick hottest spice level or Regent's Pizzeria scorpion wings are next up bc it's time to tuRN uP DA HEAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥 nO MoRE pLAyiNG Around 🙅‍♀️. Before the year ends

Uzi dropped "Just Wanna Rock"! Was not expecting him to drop in Oct again less than a year after "Demon High" and he already dropped R&W EP and other singles back in July. 

People on the Uzi sub saying it sounds unfinished and could use another verse or more substance but others say it's not supposed to be that deep bc it's just a Jersey club dance song. Personally, I'm glad for another single and new direction but highly doubt this signals any sort of rollout. The earliest I predict he will drop *Pink Tape* is sometime in 2023. As for when *Forever Young* will drop - if that's even the title still- well, it's anyone's guess
