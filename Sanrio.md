_Her Loss_ dropped! 🗡️x🦉🔥 Unfortunately, _HEROES AND VILLAINS_ got delayed for "sample clearance" and definitely not bc someone else was dropping today.

Also Stop Breathing has finally made its way onto carti's top 10 popular list!!!!!! (May I humbly add that I predicted a few months ago this might one day happen due to it being the only song on WLR that was gaining streams at a considerable rate under Sky, Vamp Anthem, and ILoveUIHateU)
