Also "Just Wanna Rock" ðŸ•ºðŸª© climbed to #3 position on Uzi's popular songs. Already it's doing better than "Demon High" which had a peak position of maybe #9 last fall but I still like both the songs for their different directions

hOW IS iT ThursdaY but today is the first time I've been to Geisel this WEEk????? That's new

Also last night (technically early this morning at like 3a), I was playing some PvZ and realized why you need two garlics on the edge rows. If a pole vaulter jumps over the first one, he'll still get diverted by the second. But I modified that strategy to be spike weed/spike rock, then the two garlics after in case a zomboni comes. Now the only case where the garlic diversion would fail is if...hold on, what if I did spike rock, two garlics, and then two chompers after the two garlics? That way if a pogo zombie comes, it would jump over the garlic and rocks, but get eaten when it tries to jump over either of the chompers. Okay, well now the only way the strategy would fail would be if a Gargantuar comes along since even a doom shroom can't take it out in one shot. On the other hand, cob cannons... well you would still need two shots nvm. Imagine if they made upgrades to upgrade plants
