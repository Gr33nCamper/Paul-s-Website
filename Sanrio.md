**July 07, 2023:** 

hey. been a while .. ðŸ™ƒ

&nbsp;

I realized this is easier to update and read than the journal

Since I can type faster and more legibly than I can write

Allowing me to describe things at greater lengths

But anyways

here's what happened today 

-

Called Ed on FaceTime, he was ranting about how Tristan was being unreasonable based on his interpretation of the story

In other news, he agrees with Marcus Aurelius' quote that the quality of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts
(e.g. to not be depressed, don't think about depressing things). Gee? Who knew!

He hates SoCal btw 

I disagree 

The weather's nice, I have church family here, puts distance between me and home, 
and I can take it slower out here just to name a few things. Oh, and did I mention the beach? And Raising Cane's, Main Chick, and Reading Cinemas? And how Vons is right next to LR? And how the bus is super convenient in summer now that it's barely even full? Come on man, you already know summer 2023 in SD >> summer 2022 back home and it's only been like two weeks

Finally finished the breakfast burrito that was in the fridge since last Sat

Went to Geisel Summer Table for the first time 

Read a little bit of Walden (ok just the foreword and part of the intro)

-

Softball game was a striking success ðŸ¥Ž

Ran to home 2x, got out once 

Caught a pop fly

-

Finished _A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23_

Did a Hot Ones interviewbut thankfully the questions weren't too serious

Okay actually one asked what I wanted to be written on my tombstone

I said "Fully spent torch" as in I gave everything I had and burned brightly during my time alive

Wings weren't too bad, at most 40% of the Supreme

-

Played Saboteur

Got exposed on the first round bc I was one saboteur against the world :(

Second round there were three saboteurs so we easily won xP
