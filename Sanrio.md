watching JJBA alone in da library ðŸ“š after 10p on 2nd floor... kinda a vibe??? 

but I don't think it can beat watching a movie alone in theatres. Especially not when I saw Avatar bc it was super late and barely anyone was there so I could have personal space and form my own opinion w/o hearing commentary from someone else
