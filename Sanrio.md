First nighttime run on UCSD track. Super peaceful ðŸŒ™ 

Also I really need to listen to the vamp security playlist on shuffle more. 

Although I like listening to albums in order, I don't mind listening to playlists on shuffle bc it kinda gets boring if I know exactly which song will follow. Shuffling spices things up (Unless it's the Spotify free version shuffle). All the playlist songs I like in some way, even if the moods are different. Just like I swing between listening to certain artists, like Uzi and Carti, or the familiar and the foreign, or between wanting to see people and wanting to be alone, I figure it seems I also swing between uniform/orderly and mixed/disordered. So when I want some more cohesive or thematic stuff, I'll listen to albums in the order they are arranged
