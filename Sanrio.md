Wakanda 4EVR 🐈🐆 was awesome I thought for the first watch. A small return > to 2018 almost, thinking back to when I watched in February in AMC theatres Fremont as a sophomore. Oh and the music went hard bruh. Fits and overall style/colors looked clean and I liked the effects but the plot maybe could have been condensed more bc why did the American government need to get involved if it was only two civilizations beefing with each other. Also why did it take that long for them to learn of each other's existence bruh I thought Wakandan technology was the most advanced???
