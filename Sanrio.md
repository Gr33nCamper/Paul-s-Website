Chem 126a final wasn't too bad, a lot of it was just referring to hw during the exam 

But a part of me grieves over not making more efforts to really learn the material during the quarter, even if it wasn't that difficult. 

Since retaining the skills and knowledge can help more in the future than something to relax with, like PvZ or CoryxKenshin videos. Those are easy to do, sure, but are they deeply satisfying? Probably not as much as learning something and really being able to apply it. I feel like a lot of the stuff I know I should do I actually have the most trouble doing while the things I know I shouldn't do I end up doing more often than I'd like to admit
