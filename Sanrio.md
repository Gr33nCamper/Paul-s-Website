**Sep 26, 2022:**

Went to Math 140a lecture for the first time this quarter

(will definitely need to rewatch lectures and go through the proofs by hand) 

Got covid bivalent booster and flu shot

Ordered the chicken kra pow dish from Blue Pepper

bc i'm oVER that BK crap 🍔🍟🥤. that jus aiNT it nOW ❌👎🤮 

McDonald's I think I prefer over BK now 

But if it were up to me, I'd only get burgers from In-N-Out

OR grill them myself in the backyard / park over charcoal with the fresh lettuce 🥬, onion 🧅, tomato 🍅, cheese 🧀, and beef 🥩

I couldn't finish all the food before our lab meet up, so I had to drop it in the bag and finish later outside PC

Some grease spilled out, but thankfully that pocket has everything wrapped up in bags

Remind me to bring a spare bag for these cases 

Actually, do they even come up that often? 

I feel like 9 times out of 10 I finish eating what I buy right there on the spot haha 

What? I usually only buy food when I'm super hungry.

Hunger is dA besT sPiCE ! according to the crow from *The Adventures of Pinnochio* 

also Spike Spiegel says something similar when referring to Jet's cooking

First Chem 43a lab meeting. Only thing missing from my drawer was a teflon stir vane

But it was merely a simple task to get from the Stockroom   

People near my area are Wenyi, Daniel, Aaron, and Xavier

Reminded me of the Chem 7L days... 🤧

Where it was Max Bailey, Victor, Ben, Robert, and me

just trying to get through our experimental procedures and measure precisely and accurately

I was wearing my red Columbia rain jacket that day bc I think it was sprinkling a little

going up the stairs in Geisel

felt like I was Spike getting ready to storm the cathedral to fight Vicious in his trench coat and stuff

Fun times

but nowadays I'm not SUPER into Bebop anymore

not saying it got bad or something, but it's not really on my mind like that 

I'll have to revisit it one day in the future and see how my perspective changes

I already mentioned how slice of life seems corny as f**k now

bc it's like, I don't find going on trains or buses or shopping at stores novel anymore 

I DO THAT STUFF IN REAL LIFE. 

Now, back in the quarantine era, it was like wow would you look at that! These dudes are flying around space and fighting aliens! Holy crap is that a school with—dare I say it?—actual people in it? That dude's walking back from school on the sidewalk while the sun is setting. Dang, if only I could do that. Alas, it's more like me going to and from the bathroom and my room while watching zoom lectures, working on hw, taking notes, etc.

Don't get it twisted though, I still like Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

Not just for understanding the memes, but also bc I gotta find out how they get to Egypt and defeat Dio

Will they save Jotaro's mom from her stand?  

Young Joseph Joestar used to be my fav character, but now I think it's Jotaro bc dude is aH SavAGE 💀

Also R.I.P. Caesar Zepellini bruh 😔🕊🪦

And as for the magical vibe, I've seriously gotta compare Sailor Moon with Onegai My Melody sometime to see which one I like more 

Onegai My Melody has a cleaner look for animation bc it's from the 2000s, but the music goes crazy and the characters are very cute 

Sailor Moon has that hand-drawn, rougher classic 90s style and is so colorful, it's like my eyes are drinking rainbows

this dude Ed wants me to watch *Avatar* in theatres

before the second installment releases in December

Apparently it's the second highest grossing film of all time, with *Gone With the Wind* being the number one

I told him I'd watch on the last day of this month, bc we gotta Die Lit 

if it's an international sensation, then it needs a special day

Oh, also I got into learning some Spanish on the side 🇲🇽 

I have employed Ed Lingo to help me with this 

but actually now his instructor name is la maestra de español Zendeha

Perhaps Edith's alter-ego could bE a high school Spanish teacher??? 😝  

Right now, Paula only has one alter-ego and that is Jenny Argento (silver-haired pokemon trainer)

Her default outfit is as a cowgirl bc she and her family ranch in New Mexico 

You know, really all that is needed to complete those outfits are boots.

Fur boots for Jenny Argento, leather western ones for Paula

If she were to have another alter-ego, that one would have black hair

Other colors like blonde or pink are a little too craZY 

Some of the other modes/outfits Paula can rock are: 

1. Magical/Cutesy stuff fangirl (candy striped sweater or sailor moon longsleeve)   
3. Piano instructor in red coat with necklace 
4. Safari explorer (cargo vest, canteen, outdoor gear, khaki clothing) 
5. Chef, with hair in messy bun but hair tendrils in front at sides
6. Casino card dealer with pink jacket, tuxedo, bowtie
7. Indie Meditation Spiritual Journey enthusiast
8. Volleyball player (headband, water bottle, shorts, athletic shoes)   
9. Vampire clown cowgirl with pink shirt, gray pants, and brown boots
10. Housecleaning maid with headscarf and black and white skirt, super long socks

That's about it for now. 

Someday in the future we will have to really give these outfits a spin
