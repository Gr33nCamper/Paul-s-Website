Halloween Party>aweSOME 🎃🦇

Helping out with the opening games and seeing the murder mystery was quite the experience. 

Oh and the tortilla chips and rice and beef and salsa, guac, corn, sour cream, jalapenos, red onions, lettuce, etc????? 🍅🧀🌽🥬🥑 

Frankenstein rice krispie and da rice cake????? They really knocked it outta the park with the food.

Tried the McRib today for the first time. It tasted alright, but I think I prefer Quarter Pounders or Big Macs. Mainly got it bc they said it was on its Farewell Tour so it could be my only chance to taste. Apparently it's pork and not the usual beef or chicken

Ice water hits different when it's late at night and cold outside 🥶 tOo COLD ❄️. I like da freshness of the cold. As long as it's not frigid cold like in the midwest or snowing outside and only having a T-shirt
