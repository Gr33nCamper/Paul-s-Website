Well, I know I definitely missed something on the Chem 43A midterm today

Arrived to Peterson slightly late but it’s okay bc time wasn’t the problem

I really thought DCM and chloroform were less dense than water SMH… their densities are like 1.3 and 1.4 g/mL respectively

Appreciate the candy at the end btw🍬🍫. Prof a real one 4 dat 🤧

Being on campus on a Saturday morning is so peaceful 

Also I like this new view from the other side of Geisel facing the Snake path and CS building area. The old view of the stairs and bike path was getting boring.

Also don’t you think it’s so fake that on Thursday everyone is so thankful and spending time with family and then it’s Black Friday and people are fighting over TVs and it’s like dang where’d the thanksgiving spirit go I thought we were happy that our needs were met and stuff

KBBQ 2nite for Bryan. Happy 20th bud! 🎂🎉 So happy that some cake was brought out for him yesterday, bc I mean, well, we would have gotten him one if they didn’t but we were having trouble deciding whether to get cake or cupcakes and then there was like the planning for the mini event. It just means so much that a small burden got removed

Ok, so we didn’t actually get KBBQ. We got Outback Steakhouse instead! 

(Reminded me of 2020 summer backyard family dinner, different times...)

I liked it but these guys really forgot the grilled shrimp bruh.

Surprise visit from Gabe and Connie. Also our peers. But a pleasant surprise 

Just Dance and Smash with more people is quite the spectacle.
