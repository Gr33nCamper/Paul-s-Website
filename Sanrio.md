. MoNDaY > n0BLe vAMP hours 🧛🏾🎃

FinALLY wore on a vampire costume, which I had been thinking about since last yR 

Had a lot of fun with it :) 

Ed dressed up as Samara Morgan from *The Ring* btw

Finished listening to the last few songs from *NOT ALL HEROES WEAR CAPES*. "No Complaints" goes harder than I remember maybe because I thought Drake was kinda wack back then. Nowadays I think I like certain Drake stuff like _Honestly, Nevermind_ and _Take Care_. Also Swae Lee goes crazy. Gunna and Thugger on Metro beats is kinda strange though bc I'm more used to hearing them on Wheezy/Turbo/Taurus beats to be honest. Although, on _DS4EVER_ there were definitely Metro beats like for "alotta cake" and "poochie gown"

Casually obtained some PvZ achievements like Hypnotizing disco zombie, making the dead zombie heap go into space, beat i,zombie with at least 1000 sun left on 1st level, and Lawn Mower Man where you mow down 10 zombies with a single lawnmower (but a roof or pool cleaner also gets you the achievement)

oH! And new plant obtained for Zen Garden: Ice shroom ❄️🍄.
