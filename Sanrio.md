6 yrs since Blonde.. 

Mr. Breaux sure is taking his time. 

I mean, at this rate 

ALL $MILES, UTOPIA, P!nk T@pe, Music, and Rihanna's next album could all drop before his.

Well, as long as the album is something different 

and accurately represents him where he's at in his life

it will have been a worthwhile wait. 

(He was kidding about the "from now on, I'll only lie in my albums bc vulnerability is not the same thing as strength" thing right?)
