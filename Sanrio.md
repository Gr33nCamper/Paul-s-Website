Back in SD, didn't think the plane would get delayed more than driving 

Almost feels like a dream being back here but I recognize all of it. Yeah, it's almost like I was here watching Professor Seward's lecture videos at close to 2a in the morning or something! Or working on pre-labs for chem 43a! Or playing Just Dance on the Switch. Or drinking water from the 7-eleven bottle (it's gone now) from the fridge that I kept from the carti concert many moons ago

It's good to be alone sometimes, but if I was alone for too long, I think I'd lose my sanity and get crushed from within. And you wonder why solitary confinement is a punishment and not a reward? Possessions can't substitute having a group of people who mutually care for one another
