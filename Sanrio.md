Ed got super mad when I said yo why you coughing like crazy? Are you Walter White or something? U got terminal cancer? It was just a joke, but I guess you can't joke about stuff like that around people. I thought it was funny because of Breaking Bad

Vargas Plateau was fun. Saw da chill horse again. Also coyote, quail, and dead mole 

Wii Play Tanks Two-player 20 Mission freestyle is a little too easy now. I tried single player but these guys for real got me fighting like 8 purple tanks on my own like come on bruh. Also once I got to the invisible white tanks, I was literally just shooting at the tracks and dodging shells. There was no cover at all.

Cooked some more tomato egg stir-fry. This time there wasn't too much water, but I added a little too much oil, so the some of the eggs were too soft 

Played Super Mario Bros again with Mike and Jack. Had a lot of fun jumping on enemies and getting power-ups

Time for some more solo adventures. Ed will be occupied for some time with work and seeing Ana. At first I was like c'mon bruh but now I'm like aw heck yeah bc tbh you kinda get tired of seeing the same person again and again
