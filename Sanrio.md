Elevator? Nah I always take the stairs bRuh.

bC U nevr > kno when there's gONNa be fire ðŸ”¥

By which I mean Carti or Uzi dropping  

Unless there's several floors, in which case I would take an elevator up

but on the way down, I don't mind so much

and you get some extra exercise

I may have missed the first foundations of mathematical analysis course today 

bc I stayed up a LITTLE too late last night

was super sweaty last night

but it's all good bc I shower in the mornings 

to get rid of all the grease in one shot. 

You know, like when you wait for a bunch of zombies to enter a lane 

and then incinerate them with a jalapeno? ðŸŒ¶ðŸ”¥

I'll need to wash my pillow and blanket covers 

Also the pillow itself after I get a tennis ball ðŸŽ¾ 

bc that thing is F1ltHY

the good news is, I got up around 8:40a which is much earlier than when I've been getting up the past few days (around 11:50a)

Now I just need to sleep around 11 or 12 tonight bc if I try something super early, it won't work.

I tried that before the Carti concert last November by going to bed around 10, but I couldn't fall asleep until like 12 or 1

Also I'll shower before bed this time since I'd rather not bathe in grease for 8 HOURS
