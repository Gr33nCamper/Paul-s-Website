OH w/ Prof Brandon Seward today. It looks like I have to gain some more intuition (deep understanding) of the definitions/theorems/concepts in order to be able to prove things with less guesswork. This takes more time, but the result will be better in the end. So it might take 10 or 15 minutes to read one page, since it isn't a fiction book you can just skim through. The problems are each unique, so there isn't really a systematic way that will work for every problem. Also seting up a learning environment that is enjoyable or relaxing can lead to more effective learning since you're not stressed and you usually learn better when you're having fun. Very insightful
