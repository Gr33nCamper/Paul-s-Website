Selee surprise 20th birthday celebration outside today 🎂🎉

Sunday Night Worship service felt so unnatural going in, but more natural going out of

RAISING CANE'S PT 2 ! 🐓🔥 

This time it wasn't rushed so I got to enjoy the caniac combo. Butter on both sides goes crZY 🧈

Isn't it funny how in the present you wish you could be in a better place and that you'd rather get it over with 

but then when you look back you wish you could have enjoyed that time more when it lasted? 

So as much as 19 yr old me didn't like the rushed 7L labs, now I wish I could have enjoyed them more 

And 20 yr old me doesn't like the feeling of being stuck on one problem for super long in Math 140A or grueling late night grinds for pre-labs, post-labs or math hw and often finds 126a lectures un-engaging, but 21 yr old me will more likely than not look back on this and be like "take me back to this time, now I'm struggling with math 154 and cse 30 😭" or something
