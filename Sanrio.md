I wasn't kidding about the skit where I cast everyone as myself. My idea for it is it'll be in a Math 140A lecture. Prof Seward will be teaching the class Thm 2.34 on compact sets being closed and give the proof of that. Meanwhile, I'm in the room being like how I usually act, probably thinking about how the class is much smaller now that it's like more than halfway through the quarter and I'm super behind on hw and lectures and how are we supposed to instantly digest all this new material when I haven't even previewed it before class. Paula and Jenny will be talking to one another. Paula in a southern drawl and Jenny in an Italian accent

Looking for bottles and cans around Lake Elizabeth was easily the best adventure so far, even surpassing the DIE LIT trip. And during that trip we not only saw Claude the Albino alligator and tatanka and rode Bart and went around SF, but also got Fairwood Cafe for dinner. 

Pretty good haul, $4.50 for more than 50 plastic bottles and like 26 cans. Double the amount we got yesterday
