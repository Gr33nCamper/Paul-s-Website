[^1]: You see, those wigs weren't just for fun ‚Äî we're actually gonna be wearing them outside. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was insanely fun acting a fool in da mirror at 3 in the morning, but it's really for the character you know? Auburn/reddish brown wig for Paula Wu and silver wig for Edith Choi. When we're acting our characters, they assume Asian ethnicities for obvious reasons. Although, I might need a longer silver wig later on   

[^2]: This album kinda hitting different compared to when I first listened to it back in Spring Quarter last year. Then in June when I was walking around the Guardino area of Fremont and to the back of Lake Elizabeth when Jack was getting physical therapy. The samples are awesome and the synths are so colorful and there's like piano and orchestral stuff going on in the background but overall I think it illustrates growing up very well and moving forward in life. I mean, graduation is literally less than two years away. I definitely don't think I would have been able to comprehend what Ye was talking about back in senior year of high school and the remote era.
