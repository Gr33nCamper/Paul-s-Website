Finally tried Raising Cane's! 🐓🍞 AT LA$T. 

Got da Caniac combo w/ Arnold Palmer (half lemonade/half sweet tea). The sauce is good, but I kinda prefer the Chick-Fil'A sauce more. Texas Toast and coleslaw were good too but I think I should have gone with more coleslaw to balance out the salt. Also these dudes really didn't have cups to hold the ketchup, smh. So I was dipping fries into the sauce. 

And come on, there's only Chicken tenders? What about some wings or drumsticks?? Deserts??? They kinda need to expand their menu a little you know? I like chicken as much as the next guy, but that's not the only food I like. Matter of fact, I kinda like porkchops more now. Also shrimp and salmon.

Oh, and we went to the driving range before that 🏌️‍♂️. Actual golf is nothing like Wii Sports golf 

I think I'd be better at putting short distance tbh because I kept trying to gear up for super heavy hits but missed
