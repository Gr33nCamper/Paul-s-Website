**Aug 21, 2023:**

Weather improved, only a gentle mist this morning

And the sun even came out!

-

Stomach burning from the xtra spicy calamari combo with pepper powder and sriracha

Had to take tums and a nap

I got up earlier than usual today (6:30a) for 7a Viewridge DT

No more crazy amounts of spice for now

It's not good for your stomach and nobody asked you to do it bruh
