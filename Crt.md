**Aug 12, 2023:** 

Ran for the first time in a long time 

Feeling too stressed, so I wanted to burn it all away 

It helped and also the punk music was energizing

Although tbh, the stuff I listen to is getting kinda old

And I don't even listen to music that much anymore 

It's cool, but not EVERYTHING

Sometimes I just want to hear the birds chirping and wind blowing

-

I should really consider running more frequently, not just when I'm about to drown in stress

Also opening up about what I'm going through with God in prayer 

I know we're the church family and all, but sometimes I'm just not in the mood to deal with super heavy stuff 

Like yeah yeah we get it you're going through stuff, he's going through stuff, who isn't going through stuff? 

I guess that's coming from the perspective that somehow all our problems can cease on Earth for a short time

If only that were true 

-

Why someone needs to return home four times in one summer is beyond me

like wOW it's been SOOOO long mom and dad 

I definitely didn't see you guys like two weeks ago

Everything looks exactly the same!!!!! üòÉüëç

And it's not like I haven't lived here...idk, MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD

-

Maybe it's because I personally don't think going home really changes things

And I view the thoughts of someone who hasn't traveled as being more subject to skepticism 

Since it's obviously going to be saturated in and painted by their life experience in one location

If you ask me, people go home from college for one of two reasons: 
1. To actually take a break and think about stuff
2. Because there's nothing to do back in their college town and they don't want to be that one guy who was alone for a long time

I have no problem being alone

In fact, I wouldn't mind if I was alone in the apartment for a few days

As long as I wasn't there the whole day, only in the evenings
