Don't waste your lunch or library time

I know the Crooked Man series is fun to watch 

and that there are many genres of music to explore

but

it doesn't have to be rn

those activities are not absolutely requisite

I know you find this hard to believe, Paul

but u can still live w/o CK and music

Trust me

And they're not going to disappear anytime soon
