Fish burrito got old

also many playlists are getting old

music is no longer what keeps things fresh

you can listen to different music in the same place but it's not THAT different

being in new places helps you think more differently

Rested up, slept around 9 hrs

Thank God for the library bc I hate having to do work at home when certain people are super loud on Discord

Bc I totally needed to be updated on every single time you died and whether some guy needs to provide support

Heart melted today

when I saw videos of children in Korea bringing gifts to adults

I know it's a social experiment 

but still think I would cry if a kid gave me a hug

Because their intentions are so pure

there's nothing behind it like expecting you to do something for them in return
