Don't waste your lunch or library time

I know the Crooked Man series is fun to watch 

and that there are many genres of music to explore

but

it doesn't have to be rn

those activities are not absolutely requisite

I know you find this hard to believe, Paul

but u can still live w/o CK and music

Trust me

And they're not going to disappear anytime soon

-

Thought I had the panda rewards offer still but it must have expired

I took another L, but not for the crooked man

Stayed too long watching YouTube in PC

I need to pick only one YT video to watch, nothing more

in fact, one longer video actually might take up less time than a bunch of shorter ones

-

I wish I could spend more time outdoors breathing fresh air

Instead I'm cooped up in the library programming

or learning about algorithms for task assignment or scheduling

and polynomials and fractions and ring homomorphisms

(I really need to spend more time on cse101 since it's the harder of the two)

Which isn't bad

it's fun at times 

mainly, it's hard to get focused

If only I could commit fully and not be distracted by trivial things  

And also my legs get stiff after a while from sitting

so I'll walk along the bookshelf aisles or drink water or use the restroom

There's AC and a nice view but not really anyone to talk to

Solo elevator rides are really great, but lately I've been running into more people who need to take the elevator

so I might have to go back to the stairs just to get some alone time and exercise

-

Looks like I need either a walk in nature or a run on the treadmill

I know the library is like my second home but it's starting to get a little old

staying in the same place for too long, no matter where, will surely make me go mad
