HW9 problem 1 solved

It wasn't too bad after reviewing cosets

Didn't use the First Isom Thm at all though

need fresh vegetables

literally just been eating on campus food for the past two days

-

Well today's PA on Moore-Hodgson Algorithm is gonna be fun ðŸ™ƒ

Art of Inclusive Communication workshop starts in < 1 hr

I'll have to be at home for that bc even though the M1's battery life is good

It's not enough for 3 hrs of an online Zoom meeting bc that drains A LOT of power

Was feeling anxious this morning

Had to listen to some calming music

Piano/classical music really helps
