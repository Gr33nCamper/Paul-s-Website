**Aug 24, 2023:**

I really dislike getting pestered with questions over text that lead nowhere

Like "oh! where are you now? Whatcha up to rn? Your apt? Campus?"

It's one of the two, yes

How that affects anything I'm not sure

My daily life is not something to be too interested over

I'm not some vlogger

It's rather routine

That's why if your text isn't important

I'll answer at most one of your queries per day

-

Unless it's a social event

I don't talk just to talk

-

Also saying "nvm" after a text that isn't relevant anymore is a common courtesy

I used to think that was weird/cringe, but it just lets the other person know they don't have to answer anymore

-

Just please leave me alone man

I can hardly go more than a few days before you message me

This is getting ridiculous

Like I said, I need personal time

-

Getting out of bed felt so difficult today

I was tired

The good sleeping streak would have continued

But one night I forgot to shower earlier and had to wait for someone to finish their shower

and they take some time

One day of sleeping at 3a destroys a good sleeping habit

Fortunately, the shower thing won't be a problem soon

Once saturday night rolls around, it'll be just me!

For that shower at least

-

If it weren't for the whole job application thing and family asking me about it

and Ed being back at home expecting me to hang out like EVERY day

and the shadow of the past thing

Maybe I'd go back home again this summer

-

When I go home in Thanksgiving, I'll be sure to try to slip into the bay unnoticed

Or if I absolutely have to disclose it, to make one thing clear: 

I came back mainly for family and personal time to reflect, not hanging out with you

It's really a drain on me to be honest

All I need is maybe a few days of being at the park and outside in nature

Not just the suburbs

I actually prefer FaceTime calling Ed bc I can do stuff on the side

and there's geographic separation

If it's in-person, I'm expected to be way more engaged

-

It's getting a bit lonely here in SD

Everyone's gone or leaving pretty much

But it's been nice seeing what goes on behind the scenes

when people return in the fall like wow! so much has changed!!

And you're just like uh-huh yep we know
