(I'm gonna just use this to say whatever transitory thoughts I have, but which aren't necessarily so important that I need to add them to the main entry list)

"Shimmer" by Fuel is actually 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

IT'S TOO FARRRRR AWAYYYYYY, FOR MEEEEEE TO HOLDDDDDDD
(awesome electric guitars and drums in the background 🎸🥁)

I was just freestyling over the "Slide" beat ystrdy and singing about how if someone could really understand me and I could really understand them, then maybe we wouldn't bump heads so often. And how I only get a few times during the day where I can be truly alone
