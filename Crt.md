Don't waste your lunch or library time

I know the Crooked Man series is fun to watch 

and that there are many genres of music to explore

but

it doesn't have to be rn

those activities are not absolutely requisite

I know you find this hard to believe, Paul

but u can still live w/o CK and music

Trust me

And they're not going to disappear anytime soon

Thought I had the panda rewards offer still but it must have expired

I took another L, but not for the crooked man

Stayed too long watching YouTube in PC

I need to pick only one YT video to watch, nothing more

in fact, one longer video actually might take up less time than a bunch of shorter ones
