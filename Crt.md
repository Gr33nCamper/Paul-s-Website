**Aug 24, 2023:**

I really dislike getting pestered with questions over text that lead nowhere

Like "oh! where are you now? Whatcha up to rn? Your apt? Campus?"

It's one of the two, yes

How that affects anything I'm not sure

My daily life is not something to be too interested over

I'm not some vlogger

It's rather routine

That's why if your text isn't important

I'll answer at most one of your queries per day

-

Unless it's a social event

I don't talk just to talk

-

Also saying "nvm" after a text that isn't relevant anymore is a common courtesy

I used to think that was weird/cringe, but it just lets the other person know they don't have to answer anymore

-

Just please leave me alone man

I can hardly go more than a few days before you message me

This is getting ridiculous

Like I said, I need personal time

-

Getting out of bed felt so difficult today

I was tired

The good sleeping streak would have continued

But one night I forgot to shower earlier and had to wait for someone to finish their shower

and they take some time

One day of sleeping at 3a destroys a good sleeping habit

Fortunately, the shower thing won't be a problem soon

Once saturday night rolls around, it'll be just me!

For that shower at least

-

If it weren't for the whole job application thing and family asking me about it

and Ed being back at home expecting me to hang out like EVERY day

and the shadow of the past thing

Maybe I'd go back home again this summer

-

When I go home in Thanksgiving, I'll be sure to try to slip into the bay unnoticed

Or if I absolutely have to disclose it, to make one thing clear: 

I came back mainly for family and personal time to reflect, not hanging out with you

It's really a drain on me to be honest

All I need is maybe a few days of being at the park and outside in nature

Not just the suburbs

I actually prefer FaceTime calling Ed bc I can do stuff on the side

and there's geographic separation

If it's in-person, I'm expected to be way more engaged

-

It's getting a bit lonely here in SD

Everyone's gone or leaving pretty much

But it's been nice seeing what goes on behind the scenes

when people return in the fall like wow! so much has changed!!

And you're just like uh-huh yep we know

-

I shouldn't have expected Ed to understand

Some things people can't understand

until they've walked a certain path long enough

not to say that I'm a better person

but as a Christian, there's a certain way my life changed

-

Why did I try to justify my ways according to what the world says?

Like I said the old high school friends moved on naturally

and I got excluded from the conversation

which didn't feel good

but is at least better than them intentionally cutting me off

-

I don't really talk to them anymore

But we change and grow, and move on

I'll still cherish good memories we had together

stuff like "the pen" and track and preparing for ap exams and funny moments like changing people's backgrounds to their faces or roasting people or the meme docs

and those deep talks and stuff at Mt Hermon

Although they couldn't be with me forever, I'm glad they could be a part of my life

-

A person who constantly hates others cannot truly be happy, right?

At least that's what psychologists say

-

Personally, in that very moment last December, I would have wanted nothing more than to never to talk to any of them again and hope they feel excluded from some conversation and understand exactly how I felt, and also see that what they did was hurtful

But God doesn't view us based on our mistakes

And Jesus said to love our enemies, not just our friends

(side note: one of the most loving things you can do is pray for the plans of the wicked to fail since it may be that in their frustration, or despair, they turn to God)

If He did, then Israel would have been destroyed long ago

because they turned away from Him so many times

even after He saved them so many times and provided for their needs

I used to think this was comical, as if I would have definitely been different

but in many ways, I am no different

How many times do I forget what God has provided me with and how He led me?

Life could have turned out very differently

I didn't have to be born in America

I didn't have to have parents that love me and have stable incomees

I didn't have to have awesome teachers in elementary, jr high, and high school

I didn't have to come to San Diego for college

I didn't have to meet a group of believers

I didn't have to have the use of my limbs or have all my five senses

I didn't have to be of a height that is normal, not super tall but not super short either

How many times do I doubt that He can help when I pray to Him?

-

When Ed mentioned that he feels nothing but hatred towards Remi, part of me was angry that this is how he felt

I suppose part of me wanted to believe he knew how to act better

that he was supposed to act Christian

But we can't hold non-Christians to the same standard as Christians

It's disheartening for sure, because I know that we're not supposed to live according to our own desires and hate people

But even God, though he cannot tolerate sin, does not force everyone on Earth to love and obey Him

That would serve justice, but we wouldn't be able to have a relationship with Him

for otherwise, we would not have free will

In order to truly love, we need to have the choice to reject

-

Sometimes I feel like I'm too legalistic

like bc someone didn't do this thing like help out with outreach, they're not a "true Christian"

but you can do many good things for God 

without truly knowing Him

Not to say that it would be better if we did nothing than do things without full conviction

It's good to do good things because they're good

But we don't do bad things for the sake of being bad, only to gain something good

(see C.S. Lewis' _Mere Christianity_ or St. Augustine's _Confessions_)
