Nearly finished with Mere Christianity

It's amazing how much you can read by listening to audiobooks

Like last yr there was Huck Finn, Pinocchio, and The Mark of Zorro

This year there was Animorphs and Welcome to Dead House

As for physical books, _Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!_, _Gospel_ by JD Greer,

and _A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23_

-

Another thing: for people who say they like reading

You notice how they rarely mention which genre? 

I mean, I like reading books but it had better be a certified classic

like American literature or international classics like Crime and Punishment or The Metamorphosis or Don Quixote

or if it gives good insight into human nature or Christian life or just life tips and wisdom 

I used to be super into science fiction, adventure, and horror a lot more so stuff like Animorphs, 39 Clues, Goosebumps, How to Train Your Dragon

Fantasy not as much (although I did read Magic Tree House for a bit and also the Hobbit and LOTR and Harry Potter and forced myself to watch GOT)

idk, I guess I thought stuff about knights and castles and dragons and kings and princesses was too archaic

Now I'm more into historical fiction so if your novel is set against the backdrop of the 1800s for instance, whether it be the Civil War, steamboats and trains, fur trapping, the Oregon Trail, Homestead Act, Trail of Tears, etc but that's just in America. 

If you want to get into international stuff, there was Charles Darwin's voyage on the HMS Beagle, development of electromagnetism, Weierstrass and analysis in real and complex variables, creation of the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev, J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron, first commercial automobile sold, Thomas Edison patents the lightbulb, Rudolf Clausius and the 2nd law of thermodynamics

There's also more to be said about what happened culturally and historically but that's for another time

It's my favorite century in history, can you tell?
