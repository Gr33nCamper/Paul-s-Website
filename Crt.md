**Aug 24, 2023:**

I really dislike getting pestered with questions over text that lead nowhere

Like "oh! where are you now? Whatcha up to rn? Your apt? Campus?"

It's one of the two, yes

How that affects anything I'm not sure

My daily life is not something to be too interested over

I'm not some vlogger

It's rather routine

That's why if your text isn't important

I'll answer at most one of your queries per day

-

Unless it's a social event

I don't talk just to talk

-

Also saying "nvm" after a text that isn't relevant anymore is a common courtesy

I used to think that was weird/cringe, but it just lets the other person know they don't have to answer anymore

-

Just please leave me alone man

I can hardly go more than a few days before you message me

This is getting ridiculous

Like I said, I need personal time

-

Getting out of bed felt so difficult today

I was tired

The good sleeping streak would have continued

But one night I forgot to shower earlier and had to wait for someone to finish their shower

and they take some time

One day of sleeping at 3a destroys a good sleeping habit

Fortunately, the shower thing won't be a problem soon

Once saturday night rolls around, it'll be just me!

For that shower at least

-

If it weren't for the whole job application thing and family asking me about it

and Ed being back at home expecting me to hang out like EVERY day

and the shadow of the past thing

Maybe I'd go back home again this summer

-

When I go home in Thanksgiving, I'll be sure to try to slip into the bay unnoticed

Or if I absolutely have to disclose it, to make one thing clear: 

I came back mainly for family and personal time to reflect, not hanging out with you

It's really a drain on me to be honest

All I need is maybe a few days of being at the park and outside in nature

Not just the suburbs

I actually prefer FaceTime calling Ed bc I can do stuff on the side

and there's geographic separation

If it's in-person, I'm expected to be way more engaged

-

It's getting a bit lonely here in SD

Everyone's gone or leaving pretty much

But it's been nice seeing what goes on behind the scenes

when people return in the fall like wow! so much has changed!!

And you're just like uh-huh yep we know

................................................................................................................................................

I shouldn't have expected Ed to understand

Some things people can't understand

until they've walked a certain path long enough

not to say that I'm a better person

but as a Christian, there's a certain way my life changed

-

Why did I try to justify my ways according to what the world says?

Like I said the old high school friends moved on naturally

and I got excluded from the conversation

which didn't feel good

but is at least better than them intentionally cutting me off

-

I don't really talk to them anymore

But we change and grow, and move on

I'll still cherish good memories we had together

stuff like "the pen" and track and preparing for ap exams and funny moments like changing people's backgrounds to their faces or roasting people or the meme docs

and those deep talks and stuff at Mt Hermon

Although they couldn't be with me forever, I'm glad they could be a part of my life

-

A person who constantly hates others cannot truly be happy, right?

At least that's what psychologists say

-

Personally, in that very moment last December, I would have wanted nothing more than to never to talk to any of them again and hope they feel excluded from some conversation and understand exactly how I felt, and also see that what they did was hurtful

But God doesn't view us based on our mistakes

And Jesus said to love our enemies, not just our friends

(side note: one of the most loving things you can do is pray for the plans of the wicked to fail since it may be that in their frustration, or despair, they turn to God)

If He did, then Israel would have been destroyed long ago

because they turned away from Him so many times

even after He saved them so many times and provided for their needs

I used to think this was comical, as if I would have definitely been different

but in many ways, I am no different

How many times do I forget what God has provided me with and how He led me?

Life could have turned out very differently

I didn't have to be born in America

I didn't have to have parents that love me and have stable incomees

I didn't have to have awesome teachers in elementary, jr high, and high school

I didn't have to come to San Diego for college

I didn't have to meet a group of believers

I didn't have to have the use of my limbs or have all my five senses

I didn't have to be of a height that is normal, not super tall but not super short either

How many times do I doubt that He can help when I pray to Him?

-

When Ed mentioned that he feels nothing but hatred towards Remi, part of me was angry that this is how he felt

I suppose part of me wanted to believe he knew how to act better

that he was supposed to act Christian

But we can't hold non-Christians to the same standard as Christians

It's disheartening for sure, because I know that we're not supposed to live according to our own desires and hate people

But even God, though he cannot tolerate sin, does not force everyone on Earth to love and obey Him

That would serve justice, but we wouldn't be able to have a relationship with Him

for otherwise, we would not have free will

In order to truly love, we need to have the choice to reject

-

Sometimes I feel like I'm too legalistic

like bc someone didn't do this thing like help out with outreach, they're not a "true Christian"

but you can do many good things for God 

without truly knowing Him

Not to say that it would be better if we did nothing than do things without full conviction

It's good to do good things because they're good

But we don't do bad things for the sake of being bad, only to gain something good

(see C.S. Lewis' _Mere Christianity_ or St. Augustine's _Confessions_)

PSST. Hey me! It's really great that you know exactly what I mean without me having to explain so much context. Really, it gets frustrating sometimes talking to others. And every little inside joke or comment or subtle thing about me you already know. Perks of being you huh!

Earlier today, I thought I would be able to de-stress by talking to Ed. But it actually ended up making me more stressed because he was bringing up the whole communication thing and it just gets me a bit annoyed because I have to come to terms with the fact that I'm not super talkative. I mean, clear communication is important, but I'd rather not feel obligated to talk to EVERYBODY 24/7 if you know what I mean. Like I didn't know I had to check in on you every day. I only have so much time and energy you know! Let me recharge first and then we can talk. And it's like I'm the weird one for not wanting to be around people all the time?? Listen, I know some people are extroverts but that doesn't give you the right to say what is and isn't conventional. Plus, why do people think this is bad if it's only for a little bit? OH NO HE'S GOING TO BE ALONE FOR A LITTLE BIT I HOPE HE'LL BE OKAY. I haven't had an entire day of being alone since well, last summer. But back then I didn't really embrace the alone time. It was more like here we go again. Another day with no one to hang out with ðŸ™ƒ. You know what bruh? Who gave people the right to say being by yourself for some time is not allowed? What if I want to be alone for a little bit? Is it a crime?? Do I have to socialize every single second of the day? Also who says you need to have fifty friends back at home. What if it's just my place to reflect on my life and spend time with family?

This makes me appreciate the time on campus learning alone much more because I don't have to answer any bothersome inquiries about what I'm doing (I KNOW RIGHT?? LIKE I'LL BE READING A BOOK AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ASK??? Hmmm, it could be any number of things.... ISN'T IT OBVIOUS????).
It's really a shame that the library doesn't open earlier though. Being with people a lot, you start to notice certain things that rub you the wrong way. Like hearing Bryan yelling into a mic about his teammates' performance. Because I definitely need more of that in my life. And he'll just respond to a passing comment I make like I wasn't talking to you bruh, I'm just mad I missed this railgun shot. How would you like it if everytime you say something into the mic I asked for the exact logical reason for it? First of all, I won't do that because I simply do not care enough about overwatch or whatever and second of all, you think I have time for that?? I would need to be extremely bored to start talking about all that.

Right now, I can think, uninterrupted about many different things. I can close my eyes and pretend for a little bit, that I'm in my own little world where people can't bother me. The silence...it's beautiful. Music to my ears. Ahhhh. One awesome thing about college is that there aren't really cliques and stuff on campus. Walk alone, eat alone, take the bus alone, go to class alone. You can do many things alone without people looking at you funny. It's even better if you're a dude because people don't usually go up to you and start conversations.
