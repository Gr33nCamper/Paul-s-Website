Nearly finished with Mere Christianity

It's amazing how much you can read by listening to audiobooks

Like last yr there was Huck Finn, Pinocchio, and The Mark of Zorro

This year there was Animorphs and Welcome to Dead House

As for physical books, _Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!_, _Gospel_ by JD Greer,

and _A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23_

Another thing: for people who say they like reading

You notice how they rarely mention which genre? 

I mean, I like reading books but it had better be a certified classic

like American literature or international classics like Crime and Punishment or The Metamorphosis or Don Quixote

or if it gives good insight into human nature or Christian life or just life tips and wisdom 

I used to be super into science fiction, adventure, and horror a lot more so stuff like Animorphs, 39 Clues, Goosebumps, How to Train Your Dragon

Fantasy not as much (although I did read Magic Tree House for a bit and also the Hobbit and LOTR and Harry Potter and forced myself to watch GOT)

idk, I guess I thought stuff about knights, castles, dragons, kings, and princesses was too archaic to be entertaining

Now I'm more into historical fiction so if your novel is set against the backdrop of the 1800s for instance (whether it be the Civil War, steamboats and trains, fur trapping, the Oregon Trail, Homestead Act, Trail of Tears, etc but that's just in America), I'll be interested to read about how life was like back then

If you want to get into international stuff, there was Charles Darwin's voyage on the HMS Beagle, development of electromagnetism, Weierstrass and analysis in real and complex variables, creation of the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev, J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron, first commercial automobile sold, Thomas Edison patents the lightbulb, Rudolf Clausius and the 2nd law of thermodynamics

There's also more to be said about what happened culturally and historically but that's for another time

It's my favorite century in history, can you tell?

No praise practice this weekend bc of SDSU outreach

A relief to be sure

Today was my first time talking to SDSU students

The demographic was much different, fewer Asians

it looked like what you would expect to see in an American suburb in the 50s

I'm not too great at conversation when it's just me

Flyering is more my thing bc the interaction is brief and you can get lots of practice trying to pitch something to different people

-

I for real almost called an Uber to get to SDSU

then I changed my mind and thought about taking the trolley for an hour

but finally I messaged the GP chat and got a ride with Jonny, Spencer, and Tobi

Salt & Straw post activity

Cinammon and Honey Fried chicken was alright, but then it got so salty that I was puckering up

Blackberry birthday cake was good until it was just blackberry jam

The price you pay for novelty ice cream flavors

Should have gone with just sour cherry pie tbh

Hurricane Hilary is approaching

Will be praying that it either goes west and misses us or will not be too severe

-

It's a shame we don't really handwrite letters anymore

There's something more personal about seeing someone's written words than reading texts/emails

-

This fruit fly problem is getting out of hand 

-

I've found I detest staying up and doing meaningless activities to pass the time

It's painful to stay up after some point

like you're not even entertained

the videos aren't making you laugh anymore

so the best option is just to exit all the tabs and head to bed

4a late-night revelations? 

No, more like not thinking straight

I used to hate mornings and sunlight back in high school

Now I realize the real reason is because I was sleep-deprived

so really I only hated light and the waking hours bc I was half-dead
