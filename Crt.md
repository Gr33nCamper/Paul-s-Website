**July 11, 2023:** 

I know what you're thinking, but we didn't get a free 7-Eleven slurpee

Just a used bike and some stuff from Ranch 99 

Well

I guess I should mention why that particular Ranch 99 has a special significance..

It was the first Ranch 99 I visited with Dad coming down to SD for FA21 and moving into my Mirada apartment. It was there I got my rewards card (which they don't accept up in NorCal like c'mon bruh)

To be honest, I'm not really mad even though it's Seven Eleven day. Losing a free item isn't that bad since there's no cost

Ok technically, there's still a cost bc we would have to drive there and it takes time which we'll never get back 

So nothing is really free

Guess what arrived today? 

Da North American Wildlife poster we ordered back in June ! ðŸŒ²ðŸ¦ŒðŸ¦¬ 

which we thought got lost in transit

Gideon already got refunded for it so hopefully they don't charge extra

Since I have no use for two of the same poster

this shall be a gift

A random visit to campus Target revealed the missing pieces of the puzzle 

U know how there were the collectible GOTGV3 cereal boxes in stores from May?

Well, here is the complete set 

1. Reese's Puffs -> Rocket Raccoon

2. Cinammon Toast Crunch -> Peter Quill

3. Cookie Crisp -> Nebula

4. Trix -> Drax

5. Honey Nut Cheerios -> Mantis

6. Lucky Charms -> Groot

7. (Bonus) GOTGV3 cereal with all of them: cocoa puffs and mini marshmallows

*Speaking of GOTGV3, the HD version of the movie came out on FMovies already so now Mike and Ed can watch

Tostada night was a success! 

I was stuffed after only eating two and also we had to rush to Pryr Mtg after 

First time riding in Johnny (Eli's car) w Ryan as driver

It was weird.

Seeing Gideon not moving his arms to steer, that is

Anyways I hope there's no funny business on Friday's midterm
