OH w/ Prof Brandon Seward today. It looks like I have to gain some more intuition (deep understanding) of the definitions/theorems/concepts in order to be able to prove things with less guesswork. This takes more time, but the result will be better in the end. So it might take 10 or 15 minutes to read one page, since it isn't a fiction book you can just skim through. The problems are each unique, so there isn't really a systematic way that will work for every problem. Also seting up a learning environment that is enjoyable or relaxing can lead to more effective learning since you're not stressed and you usually learn better when you're having fun. Very insightful

_Her Loss_ dropped! üó°Ô∏èxü¶âüî• Unfortunately, _HEROES AND VILLAINS_ got delayed for "sample clearance" and definitely not bc someone else was dropping today.

Also Stop Breathing has finally made its way onto carti's top 10 popular list!!!!!! (May I humbly add that I predicted a few months ago this might one day happen due to it being the only song on WLR that was gaining streams at a considerable rate under Sky, Vamp Anthem, and ILoveUIHateU)
