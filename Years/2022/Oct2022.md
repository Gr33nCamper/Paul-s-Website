If we're talking ∆T, then I'm pretty sure a difference of 15 ºC correlates exactly with a difference of 15 K?

Bc of the common 273.15 offset so (x + 273.15) - (y + 273.15) is still x - y.

Could have sworn Professor Shpyrko said something about this back in Phys 2C for thermodynamics

Too much sauce on poki bowl, rice got drenched 🍚

Got from Makai at 6th, which I just found out existed today

Enjoyed some spontaneous Subarashi Poké and grocery shopping w/ Gideon and Bryan this evening. This time didn't soak the rice with sauce, only got Eel and the super spicy sauce which wasn't actually that spicy like not even a kick or nuthin. I'm starting to think Main Chick hottest spice level or Regent's Pizzeria scorpion wings are next up bc it's time to tuRN uP DA HEAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥 nO MoRE pLAyiNG Around 🙅‍♀️. Before the year ends

Uzi dropped "Just Wanna Rock"! Was not expecting him to drop in Oct again less than a year after "Demon High" and he already dropped R&W EP and other singles back in July. 

People on the Uzi sub saying it sounds unfinished and could use another verse or more substance but others say it's not supposed to be that deep bc it's just a Jersey club dance song. Personally, I'm glad for another single and new direction but highly doubt this signals any sort of rollout. The earliest I predict he will drop *Pink Tape* is sometime in 2023. As for when *Forever Young* will drop - if that's even the title still - well..... it's anyone's guess

watching JJBA alone in da library 📚 after 10p on 2nd floor... kinda a vibe??? 

but I don't think it can beat watching a movie alone in theatres. Especially not when I saw Avatar bc it was super late and barely anyone was there so I could have personal space and form my own opinion w/o hearing commentary from someone else

I just know i got absolutely ReKT on the Math 140A midterm 🫠

Gotta get some more practice using the definitions/theorems/lemmas/corollaries. 

Also I took a look at Cantor's Diagonalization argument on YouTube and I'm like hold on a min... I see what the goal is!

To prove that the set of all real numbers is uncountable:

Let A be the set of all real numbers and E be a subset of A (the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1 with only 3 and 4 as digits).  

Assume for the sake of contradiction that E is countably infinite, so it can be written as the set of all such numbers e_1, e_2, e_3, ...., e_n

We make a number e that differs from every number in E in at least one decimal position in this manner: 

if the nth digit of the nth number is a 3, change it to a 4. Vice versa if digit is 4.

So we see that {e_1, e_2, ... , e_n},  

(the countably infinite set containing all the numbers in E)

doesn't actually contain one number that is different from the rest and also belongs to E. 

Since we made the number an arbitrary sequence of digits this means no matter what, that subset will not contain one such number.

Thus, there is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that E is a countable set must have been false. 

&nbsp; 

Now, since E is a subset of A and clearly doesn't contain all of A's elements, it is smaller.

If E, the smaller subset of the larger set, is already uncountable 

then we can reasonably conclude that the larger set must also be uncountable 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;⬛️

Good news! The PCR test from Tues didn't detect any signs of SARS-CoV-2

Why does time go like this...

Wasn't Monday just yesterday when I was at the Las Vegas airport?

Saw Purg today on my way to Geisel. That reminds me, I should get back to work 🙃 

[^1]: You see, those wigs weren't just for fun — we're actually gonna be wearing them outside. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was insanely fun acting a fool in da mirror at 3 in the morning, but it's really for the character you know? Auburn/reddish brown wig for Paula Wu and silver wig for Edith Choi. When we're acting our characters, they assume Asian ethnicities for obvious reasons. Although, I might need a longer silver wig later on   

[^2]: This album kinda hitting different compared to when I first listened to it back in Spring Quarter last year. Then in June when I was walking around the Guardino area of Fremont and to the back of Lake Elizabeth when Jack was getting physical therapy. The samples are awesome and the synths are so colorful and there's like piano and orchestral stuff going on in the background but overall I think it illustrates growing up very well and moving forward in life. I mean, graduation is literally less than two years away. I definitely don't think I would have been able to comprehend what Ye was talking about back in senior year of high school and the remote era.

Finally tried Raising Cane's! 🐓🍞 AT LA$T. 

Got da Caniac combo w/ Arnold Palmer (half lemonade/half sweet tea). The sauce is good, but I kinda prefer the Chick-Fil'A sauce more. Texas Toast and coleslaw were good too but I think I should have gone with more coleslaw to balance out the salt. Also these dudes really didn't have cups to hold the ketchup, smh. So I was dipping fries into the sauce. 

And come on, there's only Chicken tenders? What about some wings or drumsticks?? Deserts??? They kinda need to expand their menu a little you know? I like chicken as much as the next guy, but that's not the only food I like. Matter of fact, I kinda like porkchops more now. Also shrimp and salmon.

Oh, and we went to the driving range before that 🏌️‍♂️. Actual golf is nothing like Wii Sports golf 

I think I'd be better at putting short distance tbh because I kept trying to gear up for super heavy hits but missed

**Oct 24, 2022:**

One yr since last Carti tweet, nearly 8 months since last IG post, 3 days since last IG story (but it was only promo for Narcissist merch).

The merch ain't it btw. 

Almost 1 yr, 7 months since Carti's last music video (for his own song, ik he was featured in the MTR mv). 2 yr anniversary of WLR will be here sooner than we think 🧛🏾‍♀️🎄

pHO La Jolla 🍜 > toDAy 4 dinner . It was good but a little overpriced

Oh also the Vietnamese bbq pork sandwich kinda made me think about HOC3 Youth retreats back in February bc those are some of the only times I ever ate Vietnamese sandwiches. Good memories. And I like da sandwich

DA NOTEBOOK ARRIVED! 📕 THANK U Angel Santos! 🙏

You already know I'll be consulting it for those 140A proofs. 

And you really are too modest, don't you know I felt as if I had stumbled across the notebook of a famous mathematician when I opened the book???? Like it could have been Newton or Leibneiz's notebook or something, you know?

&nbsp;

**Oct 26, 2022:**

First nighttime run on UCSD track. Super peaceful 🌙 

Also I really need to listen to the vamp security playlist on shuffle more. 

Although I like listening to albums in order, I don't mind listening to playlists on shuffle bc it kinda gets boring if I know exactly which song will follow. Shuffling spices things up (Unless it's the Spotify free version shuffle). All the playlist songs I like in some way, even if the moods are different. Just like I swing between listening to certain artists, like Uzi and Carti, or the familiar and the foreign, or between wanting to see people and wanting to be alone, it lookw like I also swing between uniform/orderly and mixed/disordered. So when I want some more cohesive or thematic stuff, I'll listen to albums in the order they are arranged

Also "Just Wanna Rock" 🕺🪩 climbed to #3 position on Uzi's popular songs. Already it's doing better than "Demon High" which had a peak position of maybe #9 last fall but I still like both the songs for their different directions

hOW IS iT ThursdaY but today is the first time I've been to Geisel this WEEk????? That's new

Also last night (technically early this morning at like 3a), I was playing some PvZ and realized why you need two garlics on the edge rows. If a pole vaulter jumps over the first one, he'll still get diverted by the second. But I modified that strategy to be spike weed/spike rock, then the two garlics after in case a zomboni comes. Now the only case where the garlic diversion would fail is if...hold on, what if I did spike rock, two garlics, and then two chompers after the two garlics? That way if a pogo zombie comes, it would jump over the garlic and rocks, but get eaten when it tries to jump over either of the chompers. Okay, well now the only way the strategy would fail would be if a Gargantuar comes along since even a doom shroom can't take it out in one shot. On the other hand, cob cannons... well you would still need two shots nvm. Imagine if they made upgrades to upgrade plants
