If we're talking ∆T, then I'm pretty sure a difference of 15 ºC correlates exactly with a difference of 15 K?

Bc of the common 273.15 offset so (x + 273.15) - (y + 273.15) is still x - y.

Could have sworn Professor Shpyrko said something about this back in Phys 2C for thermodynamics

Too much sauce on poki bowl, rice got drenched 🍚

Got from Makai at 6th, which I just found out existed today

btw I asked the TA Richa and she confirms that a temp. difference of 15ºC is equivalent to said difference in K

Enjoyed some spontaneous Subarashi Poké and grocery shopping w/ Gideon and Bryan this evening. This time didn't soak the rice with sauce, only got Eel and the super spicy sauce which wasn't actually that spicy like not even a kick or nuthin. I'm starting to think Main Chick hottest spice level or Regent's Pizzeria scorpion wings are next up bc it's time to tuRN uP DA HEAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥 nO MoRE pLAyiNG Around 🙅‍♀️. Before the year ends

Uzi dropped "Just Wanna Rock"! Was not expecting him to drop in Oct again less than a year after "Demon High" and he already dropped R&W EP and other singles back in July. 

People on the Uzi sub saying it sounds unfinished and could use another verse or more substance but others say it's not supposed to be that deep bc it's just a Jersey club dance song. Personally, I'm glad for another single and new direction but highly doubt this signals any sort of rollout. The earliest I predict he will drop *Pink Tape* is sometime in 2023. As for when *Forever Young* will drop - if that's even the title still - well..... it's anyone's guess

watching JJBA alone in da library 📚 after 10p on 2nd floor... kinda a vibe??? 

but I don't think it can beat watching a movie alone in theatres. Especially not when I saw Avatar bc it was super late and barely anyone was there so I could have personal space and form my own opinion w/o hearing commentary from someone else

I just know i got absolutely ReKT on the Math 140A midterm 🫠

Gotta get some more practice using the definitions/theorems/lemmas/corollaries. 

Also I took a look at Cantor's Diagonalization argument on YouTube and I'm like hold on a min... I see what the goal is!

To prove that the set of all real numbers is uncountable:

Let A be the set of all real numbers and E be a subset of A (the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1 with only 3 and 4 as digits).  

Assume for the sake of contradiction that E is countably infinite, so it can be written as the set of all such numbers e_1, e_2, e_3, ...., e_n

We make a number e that differs from every number in E in at least one decimal position in this manner: 

if the nth digit of the nth number is a 3, change it to a 4. Vice versa if digit is 4.

So we see that {e_1, e_2, ... , e_n},  

(the countably infinite set containing all the numbers in E)

doesn't actually contain one number that is different from the rest and also belongs to E. 

Since we made the number an arbitrary sequence of digits this means no matter what, that subset will not contain one such number.

Thus, there is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that E is a countable set must have been false. 

&nbsp; 

Now, since E is a subset of A and clearly doesn't contain all of A's elements, it is smaller.

If E, the smaller subset of the larger set, is already uncountable 

then we can reasonably conclude that the larger set must also be uncountable
