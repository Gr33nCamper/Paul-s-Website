Drove through desert, sleet, hills, but finally made it back home

Happy Lamb Hot Pot vastly exceeded my expectations. Those fish balls and mushrooms were sensational!

There was a college football game going on and Purdue was kinda getting wrecked. You ever seen a score difference where one side has 7x the points of the other?...like at that point can we just mercy rule or something? It's kind of obvious where this is going right? 

Is there even the tiniest, most remote, inkling of a possibility for a final quarter recovery in less than 15 min?

Lake Elizabeth and Coyote Hills got turned into swamps. 

And it was still raining. 

4 inches of rain on the last day of the year, golly can you believe it!

Back in SD, didn't think the plane would get delayed more than driving 

Almost feels like a dream being back here but I recognize all of it. Yeah, it's almost like I was here watching Professor Seward's lecture videos at close to 2a in the morning or something! Or working on pre-labs for chem 43a! Or playing Just Dance on the Switch. Or drinking water from the 7-eleven bottle (it's gone now) from the fridge that I kept from the carti concert many moons ago

It's good to be alone sometimes, but if I was alone for too long, I think I'd lose my sanity and get crushed from within. And you wonder why solitary confinement is a punishment and not a reward? Possessions can't substitute having a group of people who mutually care for one another
