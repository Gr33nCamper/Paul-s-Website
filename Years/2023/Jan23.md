There was a college football game going on and Purdue was kinda getting wrecked. You ever seen a score difference where one side has 7x the points of the other?...like at that point can we just mercy rule or something? It's kind of obvious where this is going right? 

Is there even the tiniest, most remote, inkling of a possibility for a final quarter recovery in less than 15 min?
